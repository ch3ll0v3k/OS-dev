notes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="intel-architecture">Intel Architecture</h3>
<p>The first thing probably going through your mind at the header here is "Didn't
we just talk about the Intel architecture"? Yes, indeed. The background notes
talked about the Intel CPU architecture; now, we're going to talk about the
rest of the motherboard.</p>
<h4 id="cpu-communication">CPU communication</h4>
<p>So, what components are there to talk about? The CPU is obviously the big one;
hopefully you already have a decent idea of how the CPU functions internally.
However, we haven't mentioned how the CPU communicates with the rest of the
hardware present within a computer system.</p>
<p>There are three main methods of communication: ports, interrupts, and
memory-mapped I/O. We'll go in order.</p>
<p>Intel CPUs have 65,536 <sup id="fnref:port-count"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:port-count" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> different "ports" available for
communication purposes.  These are somewhat orthogonal to the main memory and
allow for CPU-controlled, point-to-point bidirectional communication with
peripherals.  That is to say, the CPU has ultimate control over when data is
sent or received. Ports are also somewhat slow, on the order of 300-400
nanoseconds between consecutive writes.  It is, however, the first issue that
needs our attention: the CPU decides when to read or write. While polling is a
plausible solution to this issue, event-based systems are in general much nicer
to work with.</p>
<p>This is the issue that interrupts are designed to handle. When an interrupt is
issued to the processor, whatever code is executing is temporarily paused, and
the interrupt handler begins execution instead (on a new stack, with register
contents saved, etc. etc.). After the interrupt handler is finished, the
original code being executed can resume. This is extremely useful, as one might
imagine; interrupts are also used internally to the processor to handle events
such as invalid memory accesses and other exceptional conditions. There are 256
different interrupts available, of which the first 32 are reserved; hence,
there are 224 useful interrupts available.</p>
<p>The last, and probably most useful mechanism of communication, is that of
memory-mapped I/O. What this means is that writes to particular memory
addresses are not actually stored on the main system memory; instead, the data
lines are redirected out to some piece of hardware for processing. This has the
advantage of being fast (just as fast as main memory accesses!), thus avoiding
the issue of ports requiring a significant delay between writes.<sup id="fnref:port-speed"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:port-speed" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
They are also somewhat more flexible when the concept of virtual memory is
introduced, removing clunky protection mechanisms like the I/O permission bit
mask in the TSS (which we'll talk about later!) in favour of re-using the
already mature paging mechanisms.</p>
<p>Now, back to the subject of interrupts. There is a little bit of a problem:
external interrupts are handled asynchronously, while interrupt handling is
inherently synchronous. And what about the case of multiple processors? How do
we decide which CPU handles an interrupt from, say, a hardware device?</p>
<p>This is the job of the I/O APIC, or the Input/Output Advanced Programmable
Interrupt Controller. It's a separate chip that sits on the motherboard and
dispatches hardware interrupts to processors according to how it is programmed.</p>
<p>These "external" (hardware) interrupts are differentiated by the internal
interrupt-handling mechanism by means of a new name: IRQs, or "Interrupt
ReQuests". The I/O APIC is responsible for converting IRQs into actual
interrupts on the processor.</p>
<p>To recap: the CPU can communicate with external devices via ports and
memory-mapped I/O; external devices can communicate back via ports,
memory-mapped I/O, and interrupt requests. Interrupt requests are handled by
the I/O APIC, which passes off the interrupt to some processor for processing.</p>
<h4 id="hardware-organization">Hardware organization</h4>
<p>The next topic to talk about is how the hardware bus is actually organized.
While there are many different standards out there for providing host/slave
communication (USB, PCI, Firewire, I<sup>2</sup>C, SMBus, SPI, and CAN to name
a few), the one that is particularly interesting for the x86_64 case is PCI
(Peripheral Component Interconnect).</p>
<p>Most modern x86_64 systems use the PCI bus for accessing external hardware.
Without getting into too many details, the main idea of PCI is that you have a
tree-like bus system that allows for devices to communicate between each other;
communication is not limited to CPU/device transfers. Most modern
x86-compatible hardware devices that are not integrated onto the CPU
northbridge or southbridge (and some that are!) use PCI for communication.</p>
<p>If we have time, we'll talk about PCI in much greater detail later on; it's
quite essential for doing anything other than an extremely small kernel. Want
to access a hard drive at a speed of greater than 16MB/s? You'll want to
communicate with the ATA controller for that, which is a PCI device. Want to
start working on USB support for your kernel? The USB controller is usually a
PCI device. Communicate with a graphics card? PCI device. Network card? PCI
device. Sound card? Guess what --- it's a PCI device. As such, interfacing with
the PCI bus is crucial for doing just about anything non-trivial.</p>
<p>However, the PCI specification is 344 pages long (and the PCI express spec a
further 860 pages), and to use most PCI devices you'll need an AML interpreter
for ACPI; you can write one yourself (another 958-page specification) or use
ACPICA (a mere 282 pages of documentation, plus some of the ACPI spec to
understand what's happening) and . . . you get the picture. It's complicated.</p>
<p>Even if we don't get around to ACPI and PCI{,e} in this workshop, I will try to
put up some overall notes on the subject for your use later in case you want to
expand upon your kernel.</p>
<h3 id="memory-map">Memory map</h3>
<p>There are several regions of memory that should not be reused, as they contain
(potentially) useful information about the system. These include the BDA (BIOS
Data Area), EBDA (Enhanced BIOS Data Area), MP tables, ACPI tables, and so
forth.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to us are the BDA and the ACPI tables. The BDA is
located at address <code>0x400</code> and is 152 bytes long. The interesting values are,
in particular, <code>word [0x400]</code> and <code>byte [0x475]</code> -- the port for the first
installed serial port, and the number of detected hard drives, respectively.</p>
<p>We'll talk <em>way</em> more about the ACPI tables when we get to LAPIC setup, SMP,
and all that fun stuff. For the moment, all that's important to know is that
the ACPI tables are important.</p>
<h3 id="legacy-booting">(Legacy) booting</h3>
<p>There are a couple of ways that a modern x86_64 system can boot: legacy boot,
UEFI, and PXE to name a few. The simplest of these, and hence the one that we
will focus on, is the so-called "legacy" boot process.</p>
<p>It's referred to as such due to its origins, the original IBM PC. The idea is
that a particular part of each hard drive/floppy disk/etc. contains a special
signature that marks the disk as "bootable", e.g. that it has code appropriate
for execution. Being the age it is, the signature is not exactly very exciting.
To wit, the 511th and 512th bytes of the disk must contain <code>0x55</code> and <code>0xaa</code>,
respectively.  If so, then the preceding 445 bytes are used as code
<sup id="fnref:floppycode"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:floppycode" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, loaded to physical address <code>0x7c00</code>.</p>
<p>445 bytes is not very much code, though, and certainly is not enough for a
fully-fledged kernel. So, the usual boot process does not involve directly
executing the kernel, but instead begins with a bootloader.</p>
<p>The job of the bootloader is to load the kernel from disk and into memory, then
jump to the kernel entry point so that the rest of the boot process can begin.
Bootloaders are kind of difficult to write, for obvious reasons: you need to
have full hard drive and filesystem drivers in 445 bytes, or else make some
hack-ish shortcuts (such as hardcoding the LBA location on disk of a file).
Furthermore, the kernel is likely stored in a very particular format, and so
the bootloader needs to know a fair amount of information about the kernel in
order to load it into memory appropriately.</p>
<p>However, some intelligent people noticed this issue and came up with a standard
called the Multiboot standard. The idea of the Multiboot standard is to try and
fix the interface between bootloader and kernel. Since we don't want to write a
bootloader -- I don't think it's very interesting work, at least not compared
to the other topics at hand -- we'll just write our kernels to be
Multiboot-compatible.</p>
<p>Without going into too many details, the general idea is that
Multiboot-compatible bootloaders are supposed to be able to load ELF
executables into memory, so long as a special Multiboot header is found early
on within the file. The header, three dwords in length, should contain
<code>0x1badb002</code> for the first "magic" dword; the second contains flags that
describe how the kernel should be loaded. The third dword is a checksum, such
that the sum of all three dwords (modulo <img alt="Generated by LaTeX" src="/img/gen/fc1ad1e8be2d915908e89ee69245646d.png" style="vertical-align: 0px;" /> of course) is zero.</p>
<p>Everything else -- the entry point, etc. -- is read from the ELF information.
This is wonderful, because it means that we can re-use the existing Linux
toolchain to generate our kernels, albeit with some careful restrictions. This
is not to say that we have access to libc and all our usual userspace goodies,
of course -- we still don't -- but at the very least we don't have to find/make
a special compiler to get our kernel development off the ground.</p>
<p>In particular, we need to ensure two things: that the Multiboot header is in
the appropriate location, and that the appropriate physical/virtual load
addresses are present in the ELF information. We'll revisit this later on in
this set of notes, after we talk about . . .</p>
<h3 id="virtual-memory-and-paging">Virtual memory and paging</h3>
<p>If you've worked with low-level userspace programming at any point, you've
likely run into the situation where you've two programs running concurrently
that are both accessing, strangely enough, the same memory address. But they're
different programs, so that memory address contains two different values. Most
people are aware of the concept of virtual address spaces, but have you ever
stopped to think about how that's actually implemented in the kernel? Obviously
one way to do it would be to, upon a context switch, copy the entire contents
of memory out of some sort of cold storage and into the correct locations. But
that's very expensive, especially when you have multiple GB's of memory to
throw around.</p>
<p>Plus, if you stare at those addresses for a moment, you'll realize that the
memory addresses in use for, say, the stack are well outside of the physical
memory installed in your system (at least I'd assume so --- otherwise, I want
some of your 16 exabytes of RAM!). Both of these are accomplished at the same
time by use of memory paging.</p>
<p>The idea is to provide a level of indirection, so that memory address <code>0x42</code>
doesn't necessarily map to the physical address <code>0x42</code>. Of course, providing a
per-byte map is a little expensive, so instead it's done on a page granularity.
Pages are 4096 (<code>0x1000</code>) bytes long on x86 systems <sup id="fnref:hugepages"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:hugepages" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To clarify, here's the idea. Suppose you have the memory address <code>0x123456</code>.
Memory is mapped with page granularity, so we basically take entire pages of
the virtual address space at a time and map them sequentially onto physical
memory. So, to figure out where address <code>0x123456</code> is going, we first need to
know where the page <code>0x123000</code> is being mapped to. Once we know that, we can
add <code>0x456</code> to the address and figure out the exact physical mapping for the
virtual address <code>0x123456</code>.</p>
<p>Now, while it's possible to have a flat list of page mappings on, say, a 32-bit
x86 system (where you only have 1048576 pages; at 4 bytes per that's only 4MB
for everything), it's not feasible on x86_64. Even with a reduced 48-bit
virtual address space (as mentioned in the background notes) you still need
512GB of memory to provide mappings for each 4KB page. As such, x86 does not
use a flat paging structure, but instead uses a tree structure. Note that for
a 64-bit virtual address space, we've defaulted to assuming we need eight bytes
(64 bits) to describe each page mapping. This isn't strictly necessary, but
it's how x86_64 works, so we'll run with it.</p>
<p>The idea is essentially as follows: pages mappings are read from page tables,
in groups of 512. So each page table describes how 512 separate pages of
virtual memory are mapped into physical memory, using eight bytes each. Of
course, not all these entries need be present. If you think of page mappings as
leaf nodes in the tree, then the page tables are just the nodes at height one.</p>
<p>We also have the nodes at height two, called the page directories. Each page
directory stores how to get to 512 different page tables, ultimately
responsible for describing a full 262,144 pages (1GB) of virtual memory
translation. Above the page directories are the page directory pointer tables
(PDPT) -- amongst the worst-named terms you'll come across, anywhere -- which
reference 512 page directories; and finally there's the PML4 (Page Map Level 4)
table, which describes 512 page directory pointer tables, for a total of <img alt="Generated by LaTeX" src="/img/gen/406b1643403c14984f38764e2c5cebce.png" style="vertical-align: -1px;" /> bits of address space.</p>
<p>If that doesn't make sense yet, don't worry about it overly much. It'll be
revisited in much more detail -- with examples! -- when it becomes more
important later on.</p>
<h3 id="a-hello-world-kernel">A Hello, World! kernel</h3>
<p>Now it's time: the "Hello, World!", x86_64-kernel style. We can break down this
kernel into essentially two steps: first, getting the processor into Long mode
(that is to say, 64-bit mode), and then printing the message.</p>
<p>I've provided an implementation of a multiboot wrapper in the refcode repo that
can be used to perform the first step, for two reasons. First of all, it's
rather complicated, and requires a pretty large amount of up-front work to get
operating correctly.  Second, it's actually pretty boring. It's a good
introduction to the CPU control registers and MSRs, yes, but the idea is to
keep the first set of notes (and hence, the first presentation) lighter than
the rest to keep up with technical difficulties and other such padding. Second,
it's the kind of code that doesn't really vary very much between kernels, so
writing it multiple times is just a little bit silly. For the sake of
completeness, though, I'll describe how to enter long mode.</p>
<h4 id="getting-into-long-mode">Getting into long mode</h4>
<p>As mentioned, getting into Long mode is a little complicated. First, the CPU
must be in protected mode, which it will be after a Multiboot kernel is
invoked. Step one, down!</p>
<p>Second: PAE paging must be set up, but not yet enabled. That is to say, we need
paging, and PAE (Physical Address Extensions) also has to be set
up as part of this process. This is done by setting up the paging tables,
enabling PAE, but not yet enabling paging. The reason for this is that how the
paging structures are interpreted depends upon what mode the processor is in.</p>
<p>Third: compatibility mode must be entered; this is done by setting the
appropriate bit in the EFER MSR. Compatibility mode is a submode of long mode
where the code being executed is still assumed to be 32-bit code, in a 32-bit
address space. Paging, however, is <em>not</em> required in compatibility mode. It is
required for 64-bit long mode, however, and so before entering 64-bit long
mode, paging has to be enabled.</p>
<p>Finally: one must jump into a 64-bit code segment. This involves setting up a
GDT with appropriate code/data segments and then performing a far jump. We'll
talk about the GDT entries in significantly more detail at some later point,
in particular when we talk about how to set up userspace.</p>
<h4 id="writing-things-to-the-screen">Writing things to the screen</h4>
<p>So, let's say we're in long mode and can execute whatever code we wish. How do
we draw things to the screen? This might seem like it will be complicated at
first, but thankfully, the default 80x24 console is memory-mapped as a
two-dimensional array at address <code>0xb8000</code>. Each character requires two bytes
to specify: first, the ASCII character to display. The second byte stores
extended attributes for the character, such as the colour and whether it should
be blinking; <code>0x7</code> is a nice neutral white colour and black background. For
more details, consult the VGA documentation.</p>
<p>Let's be nice and clear the screen to start with, though. This gives us the
following code:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Note that we can access the video memory at <code>0xb8000</code> directly like this
because "identity paging" (i.e. passthrough paging) was set up by the assembly
multiboot wrapper for the first 2MB for the sake of simplicity.</p>
<h4 id="compiling-and-linking-everything-together">Compiling and linking everything together</h4>
<p>Two things left: first, we need to compile all this code together and package
it up into a multiboot ELF executable. If you're feeling lazy (and are using
C), you are welcome to re-use the buildsystem from the reference kernel.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of completeness, here's what is happening. The
compilation stage is straightforward: an ordinary C compiler/x86 assembler is
sufficient, though we do have to inform the C compiler that a "freestanding"
environment is in use, i.e. that we do not have access to glibc. For GCC, the
use of the <code>-ffreestanding -nostdlib</code> flags are sufficient.</p>
<p>The linking is a little more complicated.  The linked code needs to know the
absolute <sup id="fnref:relative"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:relative" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> address of every part of the code and/or data in the
kernel. There is a bit of a problem, though --- by the time the Multiboot
loader actually reads and loads the ELF executable, paging is not yet set up.
That is to say, virtual memory isn't set up! So we can't actually just load the
kernel directly into the virtual memory address, because that doesn't exist
just yet.</p>
<p>However, ELF executables have support for loading an executable to a different
address than it's linked to. (To be technical, this is the difference between
<code>p_paddr</code> and <code>p_vaddr</code> in the program header; <code>p_vaddr</code> is the link address
and <code>p_paddr</code> is the load address.) But we need to tell the linker to do so . .
.</p>
<p>GNU ld, the linker that I personally use, supports this by means of a link
script. Essentially, it's a configuration file that describes how the input
object files are to be linked and loaded. It's rather annoying to set up, and I
sincerely suggest that you simply reuse the linker script provided in the
reference kernel's buildsystem. It will provide a file called <code>kernel.bin</code> that
contains the Multiboot-loadable kernel.</p>
<h4 id="running-the-kernel">Running the kernel</h4>
<p>Now, how do we actually get to the point of running this kernel? As mentioned
earlier, we don't want to really run kernels on bare-metal hardware just yet.
There's the possibility of hardware damage, and failing that, running on a
virtual machine speeds up the development/deployment cycle significantly.</p>
<p>If you're using qemu, then you can now run this kernel directly with
<code>qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel kernel.bin</code>. For Bochs, however, you'll need to
generate a disk image of some sort (I personally prefer generating CD images,
but floppies and hard drive images are also fair game) and set that as the boot
target. Note that the generated CD image can also be used in qemu. See the
background notes for how to generate a CD image.</p>
<h3 id="suggested-work">Suggested work</h3>
<p>By this point, you should have a working buildsystem and be able to run the
reference kernel to get a simple message printed to the screen.</p>
<p>At this point, in preparation for the next couple of sets of notes, you should
start writing some support code. We're working within a freestanding
environment, and very little of the C standard libraries are available.
Starting with <code>memcpy</code>/<code>memmove</code>, <code>strlen</code>, <code>sprintf</code>, and friends would be a
good place to start. Don't worry about <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code> just yet --- we'll
get to those soon enough. Writing some C wrappers around the <code>inb</code>/<code>outb</code>
assembly instructions will be handy later on, as well. Try to get
semi-comfortable with inline assembly.</p>
<p>You'll also need some data structures. This may be difficult without <code>malloc</code>
and <code>free</code>, but writing them in userspace and then porting them over later
(once you have <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code>) may be a good idea. You should consider, as
starting points, vector, linked list, balanced binary trees, and hash table
implementations. I have an <a href="http://git.ethv.net/avl.git">AVL tree
implementation</a> that may work as a starting point
for a balanced binary tree if you don't feel like implementing one yourself.</p>

<p>Several of these ports are reserved for Intel internal use, so
in reality there are more like 65,528 ports.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:port-count" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:port-speed">
<p>Ports are, by today's standards, an antiquated method of
communication. As far as I am aware, they are mostly included for legacy
support reasons. We'll not make much use of ports in our adventures in
kernel-land, but there are five instances where they will be extremely handy
(PIC, PIT, IDE, serial console, and PCI).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:port-speed" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<li id="fn:floppycode">
<p>You can use 510 bytes on a floppy, but only if you don't mind
losing the ability to have a DOS-compatible filesystem on said floppy.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:floppycode" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:hugepages">
<p>This isn't strictly true, because PAE (required for use of
x86_64) has larger pages as well, 2MB to be exact. A processor extension on
Intel's Nehalem and later processors (I'm not sure what the equivalent is for
AMD) allows use of 1GB pages. We'll revisit this in all the wonderful details
during the next set of notes.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:hugepages" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:relative">
<p>Technically speaking, x86_64 supports RIP-relative addressing, so
all that <em>needs</em> to be known are the relative locations of each bit of code.
However, for simplicity's sake, we'll not do this and instead go the more
traditional route of having everything absolutely defined at link-time.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:relative" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
