<h2>Project 3 full - File System Implementation</h2>
<p>
<b>Out:</b> Friday, May 29th<br>
<b>Due:</b> Friday, June 5th, at 11:59pm.  The submission is entirely electronic.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<blockquote>
The starting point for this assignment is a simplified file system,
<tt>cse451fs</tt>, 
the design of which imposes strict limits on both the number of files that can 
be stored and the maximum size of any one file.  In particular, no matter 
how big a disk you might have, this file system can hold only about 8,000 
distinct files, no file can be larger than 10KB, and file names cannot be 
longer than 30 characters.&nbsp; These restrictions result from the choice of 
on-disk data structures used to find files and the data blocks of a given
file, that is, the superblock, inode, and directory entry representations.
<p>
Here are the major steps involved in this part of the assignment:
<ol>
<li>
Make sure that you, individually, understand the mechanical aspects of the 
"development environment" you'll be working in.
These include how to build the file system code,
how to format and mount the partition we're devoting to your file system,
and how to run and test.
A description of these mechanical aspects can be found 
<a href="mechanics.html">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>
<li>
Improve each of the three limitations cited above:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Increase the maximum size of files (10 points).
<li>Allow for longer file names (10 points).
<li>Extra credit: allow for more files (5 points).
</ul>

Design how you want to implement these file system modifications on
disk: how you will represent your directories on disk, how file data
is indexed, etc.  There can still be a limit on any of these
properties, but <i>your improvement needs to be more than simply
altering a program constant.</i> For full credit, you must support a
maximum file size of at least 256KB, which can be achieved with a
single-indirect strategy as discussed in lecture.

<p>

If you encounter any inexplicable behavior while testing your file
system, keep in mind that it might be caused by a limitation of the
testing program and not your file system.  For example, <tt>ls</tt>
only supports 256 character file names, so if you create a longer name
with your file system, ls will <i>not</i> show it properly.  In
general, a good sanity check is to make sure your tests work on
regular file systems (e.g., on the parts of the VMWare machine's file system
that is not running your file system, or on <tt>forkbomb</tt>)
before running them on your cse451fs.
<p></p>

<!--If you still have time left over, you may do 
additional improvements for up to 10% extra
credit on this project.  Some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Make the max file size arbitrarily large
<li>Make the file system more efficient in terms of space or
CPU.
</ul>
-->
<p>
<li>
Alter the skeleton code to implement your file system.  There are two major
components to this.
One is that the user level program <tt>mk451fs</tt> must be changed to 
initialize the raw disk device with a valid, empty file system using your new 
on-disk data structures.  The other is to change the file system source
itself.
</li>
</blockquote>

<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>
While real file systems are very concerned with performance, in your
implementation you can largely ignore it.  That is, do <b>not</b>
spend a great deal of effort to produce a faster implementation.
(For one thing, because we're running on virtual machines on top of
Windows, it's unlikely you'd be able to measure much
difference.)
<li>
A description of the skeleton version of the <tt>cse451fs</tt> file system is
<a href="skeletonImplementation.htm">here</a>.
<li>
A description of the <tt>ext2</tt> file system and <tt>vfs</tt> (Virtual File 
System) is <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse451/TLKCopy/fs/filesystem.html">
here</a>.
Note that <tt>vfs</tt>, in particular, is fluid, and the current
implementation may have evolved beyond this documentation.
<li>
Potentially more up-to-date documentation is distributed with the 
linux source.  For <tt>vfs</tt>, have a look at
<tt>linux.../Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt</tt>.
<li>
A description of how dynamically loaded modules are handled in Linux is <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse451/TLKCopy/modules/modules.html">
here</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hints/Starting Points</h3>
<blockquote>
<li>
Large Files:
<ul>
<li>
An important function for creating and accessing the blocks of a file (that you 
will almost certainly need to modify) is <tt>get_block()</tt> in <tt>super.c</tt>.
<li>
Look at <tt>cse451_truncate()</tt> in <tt>file.c</tt> in order to handle file 
truncations (e.g., deleting a file uses this).&nbsp; You don't need to worry 
about this until you are sure that you can create and access your files.</li>
</ul>
<li>
Long File Names:
<ul>
<li>
All the functions that you will need to modify for your kernel module are in <tt>dir.c</tt>.
<li>
Start with <tt>cse451_add_entry()</tt> and <tt>cse451_readdir()</tt> to create 
and read directory entries with long file names.&nbsp; If listing with <tt>ls</tt>
doesn't appear correct, check how the directory structure looks on disk (using <tt>hexdump</tt>
or <tt>xxd</tt>).</li>
</ul>
<li>
General:
<ul>
<li>
If you modify any of the data structures in <tt>cse451fs.h</tt>, you will 
probably need to modify <tt>mk451fs</tt> accordingly.
<li>
As well as formating (initializing) a <tt>cse451fs</tt> partition,
<tt>mk451fs</tt> can be used to dump readable forms of the raw data on
the disk, as a debugging aid.  Try <tt>./mk451fs --help</tt> for more
information.  (Note that because <tt>vfs</tt> performs delayed
write-backs of dirty blocks, and <tt>mk451fs</tt> is going around the
file system (directly accessing the hardware device), there can be
periods of up to a few seconds when you might see un-updated blocks
using the <tt>mk451fs</tt> dump facilities.)
<li>
You <b>might</b> find the following UNIX utilities useful in your testing:
<tt>dd, df, du, diff, head/tail, hexdump</tt>.
</ul>
</li>
</blockquote>

<h3>Writeup</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Please turn in a file called <tt>writeup.txt</tt> or <tt>writeup.htm</tt> that addresses the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Describe the design for your file system modifications.&nbsp;  Include enough details so that we 
can understand your code based on this description.  This part might also
include a discussion of other approaches you considered but rejected.
<li>
What concurrency-related issues does a file system have to deal with? 
You probably didn't deal with any of it directly when implementing your 
extentions, but what did you notice when looking at the rest of the code?
<li>
What methodology did you follow in order to test your file system (for 
functionality)?
<li>
Does your implementation work? If not, what parts work and what parts don't? 
How would you fix it if you had more time?
<li>
What do you like best about your design?&nbsp; What do you like least about 
it?&nbsp; How would you improve your design?</li>
<!--
<li>If you did any extra credit, describe what you did. Make sure to describe how 
you implemented it, and how it solves the problem you set out to fix.
--></ol>
<p>Aim to fit this report into about 2 pages.
The file you submit should be in some easy-to-read format, e.g.,
plain (ASCII) text or HTML or pdf.
It should 
contain the names of all the people who worked on the project 
as well as your group name.
<p>
Your writeup will be turned in <b>electronically</b>.
</blockquote>

<h3>Turnin</h3>
<blockquote>
You will be turning in 4 files: 
<ul>
<li>A tar.gz file containing all of your modified sources
<li>Your compiled <tt>mk451fs</tt> program
<li>Your compiled fs module, <tt>cse451fs.ko</tt>
<li>A single write-up file, <tt>writeup</tt>
</ul>
<p>You <i>must</i> compile your <tt>mk451fs</tt> and <tt>cse451fs.ko</tt> 
files on forkbomb. Do not use a different machine or compiler for this.

<p>To create the source archive file, do a <tt>"/cse451/projects/makedist"</tt> from your top level project directory.

<p>Use the <tt>turnin(1L)</tt> program under project name <tt>project3</tt>.
Note: <tt>turnin</tt> will not work on forkbomb, 
so you'll need to use <tt>attu</tt>.

</p>
<p>
<tt>turnin -c cse451 -v -p project3 roxana-project3</tt> <br><br>
where roxana-project3 is the directory containing all the files for the project.
