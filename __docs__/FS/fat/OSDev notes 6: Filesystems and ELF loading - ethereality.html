    <div id="main"><p>Now that we have the ability to read and write from hard drives, it seems
logical to talk about what we can actually do with said access. While it is
certainly possible to use a hard drive as a single file, it is usually
desirable to divide it up into a heirarchical file structure of some sort. Once
we have a filesystem, this seems like a golden opportunity to make the leap
towards loading arbitrary programs from disk and greatly extending the
extensibility of our kernels.</p>
<p>This set of notes is dedicated to the twin topics of filesystems and program
loading; first, we'll talk about some general filesystem concepts and issues,
and then discuss, briefly, particular examples of filesystems -- FAT32 and
and ext2. Afterwards, we'll talk about ELF (Executable and Linking Format)
files and how to load them.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-filesystem-exactly">What is a filesystem, exactly?</h3>
<p>Before we continue, it's probably good to define exactly what a filesystem is.
There are a couple of definitions around, but the one that I like is that a
filesystem is a method of structuring a flat address space of storage into
smaller, resizable chunks with enforceable limits and unique addressing.</p>
<p>In practice, filesystems usually provide a heirarchical tree-like structure
(and sometimes a graph in the case of hardlinked directories) with named nodes
to provide the unique addressing schema. The "enforceable limits" are provided
by a meta-structure with information like file sizes, permissions,
creation/access/modification timestamps, and so forth. For the moment, we
haven't really implemented support for getting the current date/time from the
RTC, nor have we talked about anything related to permissions checking, so the
only part we're really interested in is the file size.</p>
<p>TODO: more details.</p>
<p>One of the major issues that a filesystem has to address is that of
fragmentation, for exactly the same reasons that a heap has to address
fragmentation: file deletion and/or resizing. Unlike the heap situation,
however, we do not necessarily expect a file to be contiguously stored on disk,
because moving data around on a hard drive is significantly slower than moving
memory contents (in terms of either bandwidth or latency, several orders of
magnitude are involved). A file broken into multiple smaller pieces is said to
be fragmented.</p>
<p>Another major issue is that writes to the underlying hard drive cannot be
considered atomic. Bad sectors happen, as do power failures. In both cases, a
write may silently fail, not fully complete, or even corrupt existing data. In
other words, error correction is not something that can be fully brushed aside,
although we will for the purposes of keeping these notes relatively reasonable
in length.</p>
<p>Which brings up a very important point: as with ATA, we will be entirely
ignoring error conditions. If you want to write a robust filesystem wrapper,
you should consider all the edge cases you can think of, in addition to
throughly stress-testing it with random failures; I would suggest that your
implementation use a simple read/write-from-disk API such that you can
transport it out into an environment where you can control failures (such as an
automated testing framework), and then run fuzz-testing on both the input and
the read/write action successes.</p>
<h3 id="some-example-filesystems">Some example filesystems</h3>
<p>The two filesystems that I'd like to mention here are FAT32 and ext2,
though the only one we'll talk about in any detail will be FAT32 due to its
(relative) simplicity. And while the vast majority of hard drives you'll come
across will be partitioned, for the moment the partitioning scheme isn't
interesting, and we'll assume for the moment that all filesystems take up the
entire disk.</p>
<h4 id="fat32">FAT32</h4>
<p>We'll start off with a brief overview of FAT32 (more details to come later!).
FAT32 is actually a variant of older filesystems called FAT12 and FAT16, which
is what you'll see used on floppies and old hard drives, respectively. The
difference between FAT12 and FAT16 is the cluster index size (12 bits vs. 16
bits); FAT32, on the other hand, introduces a couple of nice changes from FAT16
that make implementation a little nicer.</p>
<p>There are a couple of important concepts to talk about with respect to FAT32.
The first is the concept of sectors and clusters; like a hard drive accessed
via LBA, a FAT32 partition is divided up into sectors of a particular size;
however, unlike LBA, the sector size may vary between partitions. Sectors are
grouped together into "clusters", which are the basic unit of allocation for
the dynamically-allocated portions of the filesystem. For example, a 16MB disk
might be divided up into 512-byte sectors and clusters of four sectors each,
providing 2<sup>15</sup> sectors and (roughly, we'll get to this in a moment)
2<sup>13</sup> clusters in total.</p>
<p>The second concept to talk about is the FAT (File Allocation Table) from which
the filesystem gets its name. The concept is pretty simple; you allocate
clusters to files. If a single cluster is sufficient to contain the entire file
contents, then huzzah. Otherwise, you need to use multiple clusters, and this
is where the FAT comes in. The FAT is simple a gigantic array of pointers, with
one pointer for each cluster on the disk. These are used as "next" pointers; so
if a file spans two clusters, the first cluster will point to the second
cluster in its FAT entry. This keeps the meta-informational structures at a
fixed size (no need to store an arbitrarily-long list of clusters!), at a
one-time fixed cost. The "32" in FAT32 comes from the fact that each FAT entry
is 32 bits wide, providing a maximum of 2<sup>32</sup> clusters on disk.</p>
<p>Clusters that are the last cluster in a chain (which could be singleton) point
to a special sentinel cluster. That way, you can easily append onto the file
simply by changing the linked cluster from the last in the chain (append onto
the linked list) and modifying the meta-information to reflect the new file
size.</p>
<p>Directories are handled in a very sensible way; a directory is really a linked
list of pointers to the starting clusters of files, and is stored in a linked
list of clusters itself. In this manner, a directory is really just a file that
has a special flag set somewhere and whos contents are interpreted in a very
particular way. <sup id="fnref:debugging-fat-note"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:debugging-fat-note" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In FAT32, the root directory of the partition is a regular directory whos
cluster index is stored in the FAT partition header; this partition header also
stores useful information like the number of clusters and so forth. Details in
a moment. (Note that FAT12 and FAT16 use a special "root directory" area, this
leads to special-casing in the implementation and is in general annoying.)</p>
<p>There's a misleading statement above, actually. FAT32 may have 32-bit-wide FAT
entries, but the upper four bits are actually reserved, so you can in reality
only have 2<sup>28</sup> clusters. Subtract the sentinel clusters and you have
slightly less; however, the count is close enough to 2<sup>28</sup> that for
our purposes right now, it's "good enough". (I haven't been able to find any
concrete information on this, but I suspect they limited it to 28 bits to
coincide with LBA28 nicely.)</p>
<h4 id="fat32_1">FAT32</h4>
<p>The reference code repository contains a directory called <code>fat32access</code>; inside
is a (mostly) complete FAT32 partition manipulator, along with a file called
<code>fat32test.prepared.xz</code>. The xzipped file is a snapshot of a test 512MB
partition that contains a couple of test files and directories, sufficient for
testing purposes. The partition manipulator simply uses memory-mapped I/O to
interact; in your kernel implementation, these should probably be using the ATA
PIO wrapper that you've (hopefully) written. Please note that it was not
written with efficiency in mind; for speed purposes, it is very common to cache
many of the data structures that the provided program simply accesses directly.</p>
<p>The place to start when looking at a FAT32 partition is the FAT32 header. This
is 512 bytes wide (regardless of the size of a FAT32 sector); the format can be
seen in this excerpt from the FAT32 manipulator:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Many of these have self-explanatory names (for example, <code>sectors_per_cluster</code>),
but we'll spend a bit of discourse talking about the rest. <code>jmp</code> and <code>oem</code> can
pretty much be ignored right about now; the former is essentially obsolete and
the latter is ignored by pretty much every FAT32 driver out there.</p>
<p>The first interesting element in this structure is <code>reserved_sector_count</code>.
Essentially, a certain number of sectors are reserved at the beginning for the
purposes of this header and some other filesystem-specific information
(this can also be used for alignment purposes). The FAT begins immediately 
after these reserved sectors.</p>
<p>The next element in the structure, <code>fat_count</code>, is a little interesting.
Because corruption in the middle of the FAT leads to bad times for everyone
(except the people paid to do data-recovery), there are actually multiple
copies of the FAT on the drive, placed contiguously. <sup id="fnref:contiguous-note"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:contiguous-note" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> You
would expect that each copy is a mirror of the others, but sadly, not quite.
The entry <code>fat_flags</code> determines how multiple FATs are handled; the lower five
bits of <code>fat_flags</code> contains the "active" FAT, and if bit 7 is clear, this is
the only FAT that should be updated when changes are made to the filesystem.</p>
<p>The next several elements can be ignored in FAT32; they're part of the old
FAT12/16 header. Originally, <code>sector_count_small</code> contained a 16-bit count of
the number of sectors on disk; however, since most sectors are 512 bytes, this
limits us to 32MB disks. As FAT32 cannot be used on such small disks, this
field isn't useful (originally, if set to zero, the 32-bit element
<code>sector_count_large</code> was to be used instead). The next element of interest is
<code>sectors_per_fat_large</code>; this is the number of sectors used for each FAT. Thus,
the total number of sectors allocated to the FATs is <code>sectors_per_fat_large *
fat_count</code>.</p>
<p>The element <code>signature</code> should contain either <code>0x28</code> or <code>0x29</code> in order to be a
fully-valid FAT32 partition, and <code>serial</code> is supposed to contain a random
32-bit number that can be used to identify different disks. <sup id="fnref:birthday"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:birthday" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>With that out of the way, then, let's get to the actual clusters. The clusters
begin immediately after the FATs; and so the filesystem content begins at
sector <code>reserved_sectors + sectors_per_fat_large * fat_count</code>. The first two
cluster indices are special, so you can find cluster number <code>i</code> at sector
<code>reserved_sectors + sectors_per_fat_large * fat_count + sectors_per_cluster *
(i-2)</code>. The content of a cluster is pretty obvious for a file; it's the file
contents . . . however, for a directory, the cluster contents follow a specific
format. In particular, each is 32 bytes long and has the following format:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Something that you should notice immediately is that thre are only 11 bytes in
total for the filename. This is not a typo, but is instead a fact of life --
without some extra work, FAT32 only supports the 8.3 filenames of yore.
Incidentally, the fact that <code>file_size</code> is only a <code><span class="normal"> uint32_t</span></code> (and
is a multiple of bytes) is why older Windows systems could not handle files
larger than 4GB.</p>
<p>The first character of <code>filename</code> has a specific format. In particular, if it
is a NULL character (<code>0x0</code>), then this is the last directory entry in the
cluster that should be processed. (This is such that you don't have to zero the
entire cluster upon allocation; only the first byte has to be.) If it's <code>0xe5</code>,
then it should be skipped (it's available for future re-use). If it's <code>0x05</code>,
then the first character should actually be a <code>0xe5</code>. There's no particular
reason why the rest of the filename entries cannot store arbitrary ASCII
values, however, to maintain compatibility they should be alphanumeric or
amongst <code>#$%&'()-@</code>; filenames shorter than 8.3 should be padded with spaces
as appropriate.</p>
<p>There are six attribute bits. Bit 0 is the "read-only" bit; if set, the file
should not be modified. Bit 1 is the "hidden" bit; obstensibly, if set then the
file should not show up when the directory contents are listed. The third bit
is the "system" bit, supposed to indicate that the file in question is part of
the operating system and really, really, shouldn't be modified. The fourth bit
is the "volume" bit; it's used for a couple of reasons, but nothing that we're
interested in for the moment. The fifth bit is the directory bit, indicating
that this entry is a directory instead of a file. The sixth bit, the "archive"
bit, is supposed to be set as soon as a file is created or modified, hence
letting a backup (archival) program know which files have changed since the
last copy was made. (Assuming, of course, that the program clears the archival
bits after the copies are made. Otherwise, it's a waste of a perfectly good
bit.)</p>
<p>To clear things up a little bit, let's suppose we have a FAT32 partition that
has 12 clusters (this doesn't happen in reality -- you need at least 65,525
clusters on a FAT32 partition, but bear with me here) of 512 bytes each. On
this partition are the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li>/test.txt (200 bytes)</li>
<li>/dir/test2.txt (200 bytes)</li>
<li>/dir/test3.txt (900 bytes)</li>
<li>/dir/nested/test4.txt (200 bytes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose that there is exactly one sector per cluster, and that each sector is
512 bytes long. Then one possible partition contents would be something like
this: (keep in mind that there are other ways to do this, and please excuse the
notation)</p>

<p>This brings us to a couple of important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, all directories except the root directory literally have a "."
    and a ".." directory link that points to the current and parent
    directories, respectively. This is very useful, as the only thing required
    to store the "current" directory becomes the cluster index of the current
    directory; all other navigation can be done relative to here.</li>
<li>If a directory has the root directory as a parent, the cluster index can be
    either zero or it can be the root cluster index specified in the FAT
    header.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fat-long-name-extensions">FAT long name extensions</h4>
<p>Let's be honest: the 8.3 filename limitation is rather annoying, especially to
those used to Linux's penchant for allowing arbitrary UTF-8 characters. We'll
briefly sketch the "long names" extension to FAT, often referred to as VFAT.</p>
<p>The nice thing about VFAT is that filesystem drivers that only support the base
FAT32 mechanism can still manipulate VFAT drives, albeit without support for
the extended names in use.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty simple: each directory entry that actually references a file
is prefixed with one or more directory entries that contain the longer
filename; each entry stores up to 13 characters. So, to store a file with a 
name of "this is a long filename", we would have something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>entries[i+0] = directory entry storing characters "this is a lon"
entries[i+1] = directory entry storing characters "g filename\0"
entries[i+2] = directory entry storing actual cluster index etc. (with dummy 8.3 name)

</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this is slightly unreliable: what if a non-long-filenames-compliant
program were to remove a file with a long filename and not remove the
long-filename entries? There is also a checksum present in each of the
preceeding directory entries that allows us to determine if an entry really
belongs to a file/directory entry or not.</p>
<p>TODO: expand, include checksum.</p>
<h3 id="programs-and-how-they-are-loaded">Programs and how they are loaded</h3>
<p>On an entirely different note, now! How can we actually load programs from
files into memory? Well, the key observation to make here is that programs
really are just memory contents that we interpret in a special manner (namely,
with a CPU instruction decoder). So, really, all that we need to do to load an
executable is set up some memory ranges with appropriate content, presumably
loaded from the executable file (or zeroed out, in the case of the bss).</p>
<p>But wait --- who (or what) exactly performs this setting-up of memory ranges?
There are really two options: either the kernel can do it, or a process can
replace itself with a new executable. The former is probably the approach
you'll want to take, as the latter <a href="/weblog/003-program-loading-on-linux-2#and-now-for-something-a-little-different-loading-an-executable">can be
done</a>
but is a little awkward to get right; a kernel implementation that sets up a 
new address space with executable content has far fewer edge cases to deal
with.</p>
<p>And, on a more philosophical note --- we should stop and consider something
before progressing much further. Why do we care about loading programs? I mean,
yes, we want our kernel to actually be useful and all, but why now? There's an
old adage, very applicable, that goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the systems programmer, users and applications serve only to provide a
test load.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, it's great because it lets us stress-test our kernels with new
code from an outside source.</p>
<p>The particular executable structure that I recommend, due to both simplicity
and portability, is the Executable and Linkable Format, or ELF. ELF files are
used in a lot of places; they're Linux's preferred executable format, but are
also used on various BSDs and other platforms as well. The main reason,
however, is that they are the default executable type generated by GNU binutils
on Linux, and so creating them is extremely easy.</p>
<h3 id="general-elf-structure">General ELF structure</h3>
<p>ELF files contain a lot of different information and can be used in many
different places; depending on the program that generates them, they really do
contain arbitrary information, from executable code to DWARF debugging
information to relocation information to program data to well, anything and
everything to do with a program. ELF is, as a format, not always used for
executables; it's also used for object files and core dumps, for example.</p>
<p>However, right now we're only interested in a very small subset of information
present for a small subset of executables. In particular, we want the mapping
from file content to memory content; that is to say, which portions of the file
are mapped to which memory addresses.</p>
<p>TODO: program headers as mappings from file addresses to load addresses</p>

<p>TODO: link to <a href="/weblog/003-program-loading-on-linux-2#and-now-for-something-a-little-different-loading-an-executable">weblog</a> for self-loader</p>
<h3 id="suggested-work">Suggested work</h3>
<p>I suggest you work on an implementation of a FAT32 (or other filesystem of your
choice) driver, as well as a kernel ELF loader that creates a new process,
given an ELF file. If you can get this far, then by the end of the next set of
notes, you should have a fully-functional kernel complete with userspace
programs and a simple shell.</p>
