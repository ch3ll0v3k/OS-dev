        One of the most frightening things about Linux is the horrible word bootloader. The primary reason for this is
        the fact that most new Linux users have only ever used Windows operating systems. In the Windows world, they
        have never bothered with bootloaders. For them, the issue of a system booting was a transparent one. At most,
        they would use Windows Recovery Console to fix problems for them. Thus, they have been spared the need to learn
        about the single most important piece of software on a computer - the little program that makes it all work.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article is supposed to provide you with basic understanding of the GRUB bootloader. If you have read my
        other Linux articles, you are familiar with partitioning and Linux notation, as well as with the command line.
        The next logical step is to enhance this knowledge by taking one step further. Understanding how GRUB works and
        what boot entries in the boot menu mean will help you understand how the operating systems work, how to fix,
        recover or modify the GRUB menu to suit your needs, and how to setup different work environments with several
        operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past, we have relied on the installation setups to make the hard work for us. In fact, setting up GRUB,
        while frightening, is a quite simple and fully reversible procedure. Mastering the GRUB is a very important
        step in building up the confidence to use Linux. So if you are ready, read on.
      </p>
      <p>
        But first of all, a foreword of wisdom. This article is a compilation of sources and examples that will help
        you learn about GRUB. Of course, it's all out there somewhere, on the Internet. However, new Linux users will
        probably find the notion of spending hours searching for relevant pieces of information (especially if their PC
        won't boot) somewhat frustrating. The goal of this guide is to help provide simple and quick solutions to most
        common problems regarding multi-boot setups and installation of Linux operating systems.

      <p>
        To be able to successfully master the secrets of GRUB, you must understand one of the basic foundations of
        *NIX-based operating systems. Everything is a file. Even hard disks and partitions are treated as files. There
        is no magic. If you remember this, you will find the supposedly perilous task of tampering with partitions no
        different than playing with files using a file explorer (or the command line). Now that we have established
        this, we can move on to the more technical parts of grubbing.<br>
      </p>

        <a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId683442" id="mozTocId683442"></a><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        GNU GRUB is a bootloader (can also be spelled boot loader) capable of loading a variety of free and proprietary
        operating systems. GRUB will work well with Linux, DOS, Windows, or BSD. GRUB stands for <span class=
        "red_text">GR</span>and <span class="red_text">U</span>nified <span class="red_text">B</span>ootloader.
      </p>
      <p>
        GRUB is dynamically configurable. This means that the user can make changes during the boot time, which include
        altering existing boot entries, adding new, custom entries, selecting different kernels, or modifying <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initrd">initrd</a>. GRUB also supports <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Block_Address">Logical Block Address</a> mode. This means that if your
        computer has a fairly modern BIOS that can access more than 8GB (first 1024 cylinders) of hard disk space, GRUB
        will automatically be able to access all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        GRUB can be run from or be installed to any device (floppy disk, hard disk, CD-ROM, USB drive, network drive)
        and can load operating systems from just as many locations, including network drives. It can also decompress
        operating system images before booting them. You can learn much, much more from the official <a href=
        "http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/legacy/grub.html">GNU GRUB Manual 0.97</a>.

        <a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId718528" id="mozTocId718528"></a><a name="lilo" id="lilo"></a>What about LILO?
      </h3>
      <p>
        You may have heard about another Linux bootloader called LILO (stands for <span class="red_text">LI</span>nux
        <span class="red_text">LO</span>ader). While a sensible option for many Linux users, I believe that GRUB is a
        better choice, for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>LILO supports only up to 16 different boot selections; GRUB supports an unlimited number of boot entries.
        </li>
        <li>LILO cannot boot from network; GRUB can.
        </li>
        <li>LILO must be written again every time you change the configuration file; GRUB does not.
        </li>
        <li>LILO does not have an interactive command interface.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All in all, it seems that GRUB is the winner. So let's see what this baby can do.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId616834" id="mozTocId616834"></a><a name="how_grub_works" id=
        "how_grub_works"></a>How does GRUB work?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When a computer boots, the BIOS transfers control to the first boot device, which can be a hard disk, a floppy
        disk, a CD-ROM, or any other BIOS-recognized device. We'll concentrate on hard disks, for the sake of
        simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first sector on a hard is called the <span class="red_text">Master Boot Record (MBR)</span>. This sector is
        only 512 bytes long and contains a small piece of code (446 bytes) called the primary boot loader and the
        partition table (64 bytes) describing the primary and extended partitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, MBR code looks for the partition marked as active and once such a partition is found, it loads its
        boot sector into memory and passes control to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        GRUB replaces the default MBR with its own code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, GRUB works in <span class="red_text">stages</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="red_text">Stage 1</span> is located in the MBR and mainly points to <span class="red_text">Stage
        2</span>, since the MBR is too small to contain all of the needed data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="red_text">Stage 2</span> points to its configuration file, which contains all of the complex user
        interface and options we are normally familiar with when talking about GRUB. Stage 2 can be located anywhere on
        the disk. If Stage 2 cannot find its configuration table, GRUB will cease the boot sequence and present the
        user with a command line for manual configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="red_text">Stage 1.5</span> also exists and might be used if the boot information is small enough
        to fit in the area immediately after MBR.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Stage architecture allows GRUB to be large (~20-30K) and therefore fairly complex and highly configurable,
        compared to most bootloaders, which are sparse and simple to fit within the limitations of the Partition Table.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId60013" id="mozTocId60013"></a><a name="grub_notation" id=
        "grub_notation"></a>GRUB notation
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section is intended to help you get familiar with GRUB, without touching anything. The next section deals
        with actual files and manual configuration. GRUB has its own notation, which is very similar yet somewhat
        different from the general notation a typical Linux user might be used to. Now, here's an example of a typical
        GRUB entry:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        (hd0,1)
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>The <span class="red_text">brackets</span> are a must; all devices listed in GRUB menu must be enclosed in
        brackets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">hd</span> stands for hard disk; alternatively, <span class="red_text">fd</span> stands
          for floppy disk, <span class="red_text">cd</span> stands for CD-ROM etc.
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="red_text">first number</span> (integer for geeks) refers to the <span class=
        "red_text">physical hard drive number</span>; in this case, the <span class="red_text">first</span> drive, as
        they are counted from <span class="red_text">zero</span> up. For example, <span class="red_text">hd2</span>
        refers to the <span class="red_text">third physical hard drive</span>.
        </li>
        <li>The <span class="red_text">second number</span> refers to the <span class="red_text">partition
        number</span> of the <span class="red_text">selected hard drive</span>; again, partitions are counted from
        <span class="red_text">zero</span> up. In this case, <span class="red_text">1</span> stands for the
          <span class="red_text">second</span> partition.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From here, it is evident that GRUB (menu) does not discriminate between IDE or SCSI drives or primary or
        logical partitions. The task of deciding which hard drive or partition may boot is left to BIOS and Stage 1. As
        you see, the notation is very simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="red_text">Primary</span> partitions are marked from <span class="red_text">0</span> to
        <span class="red_text">3</span> <span class="red_text">(hd?,0)</span>, <span class="red_text">(hd?,1)</span>,
        <span class="red_text">(hd?,2)</span>, <span class="red_text">(hd?,3)</span>. <span class=
        "red_text">Logical</span> partitions in the <span class="red_text">extended</span> partition are counted from
        <span class="red_text">4</span> up, regardless of the actual number of primary partitions on the hard disk,
        e.g. <span class="red_text">(hd1,7)</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entries alone are not enough to boot an operating system though. GRUB also needs to know what operating
        system <span class="red_text">images</span> to load. These are assigned as parameters to each of the called
        devices, including special flags (switches). For example, Windows Safe Mode is a special flag. Here is an
        example of a GRUB menu booting only Ubuntu.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img style="width: 720px; height: 505px;" alt="GRUB Ubuntu boot" src=
        "../images/computers/grub_ubuntu_boot.jpg">
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example of a GRUB menu from a computer with triple boot (SUSE 10.2, Ubuntu 6.10 and Windows XP). This
        is the actual menu.lst on one of my real machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img style="width: 720px; height: 512px;" alt="GRUB triple boot" src=
        "../images/computers/grub_triple_boot.jpg">
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's try to understand what the entries mean. Only uncommented lines count. <span class=
        "red_text">Comments</span> are marked with <span class="red_text">#</span>. The lines that have a series of
        small gray <span class="red_text">x</span>s showing are in indication that text therein belongs to the line
        preceding it. In other words, there text simply dropped to another line to visually accommodate the text editor
        and screen resolution limitations.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        default 0<br>
        timeout 8
      </div>
      <p>
        The first line (<span class="red_text">default 0</span>) means that the first operating system listed will be
        booted. In this case, it's SUSE 10.2. The second line (<span class="red_text">timeout 8</span>) tells how much
        time (seconds) the user has to make his choice before the default entry is loaded. Simple, isn't it?
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        gfxmenu (hd0,2)/boot/message
      </div>
      <p>
        The GRUB menu can also be graphic. The fancy stuff needed to present the user with a colorful background and
        possibly some extras is located on the <span class="red_text">first</span> physical disk, <span class=
        "red_text">third</span> partition (hd0,2). This is a <span class="red_text">primary</span> partition, as we
        have seen earlier.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        title openSUSE 10.2<br>
        root (hd0,2)<br>
        kernel /boot/vmlinuz-...<br>
        initrd /boot/initrd.img-...
      </div>
      <p>
        This is the first operating system entry in the menu.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">title</span> is as simple as it sounds. It's merely a string that's meant to help the
          user read the menu in human terminology.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">root (hd0,2)</span> tells GRUB where its configuration files are located. In this
          instance, they can be found under <span class="red_text">(hd0,2)/boot/grub</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">kernel /boot/vmlinuz-...</span> boots the actual kernel <span class=
          "red_text">image</span>. There can be many such images available. The fact there is no device specified
          before the <span class="red_text">/boot/vmlinuz</span> indicates the image is located on the <span class=
          "red_text">same</span> partition as the GRUB itself. This is often the default case for your primary choice
          of operating system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">initrd /boot/initrd.img-...</span> is the temporary file system that makes system
          preparations - adapts generic kernel image to specific hardware - before the real root is loaded.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The extra switches used after the kernel indicate where the actual root is located, what graphic mode is used
        and where the swap partition resides. This article will not go into detail regarding the more advanced GRUB
        configurations.

        <li>Again, <span class="red_text">title</span> indicates a name, in this case fancily adorned with technical

          <span class="red_text">kernel (hd0,8)/boot/vmlinuz-...</span> points to the <span class="red_text">9th</span>
          partition on the <span class="red_text">first</span> hard disk <span class="red_text">(hd0,8)</span>.
          Accidentally, the root flag <span class="red_text">(/dev/sda9)</span> indicates that the root partition is
          the <span class="red_text">same</span> as the one containing the kernel image. Normally, this is the case,
          and for the sake of simplicity, you will want this option during your installations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">initrd (hd0,8)/boot/initrd.img-...</span> nothing new here.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note regarding kernel images and root partitions: On older computers with BIOS that do not support access to
        more than the first 1024 cylinders, you might setup a boot partition that contains the kernel image, while the
        root itself is located elsewhere. But people with computers younger than the botched Y2K crisis need not worry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing you might notice is that the Ubuntu entry is fairly detailed. This feature is called <span class=
        "red_text">Multi-boot Compliance</span>; openSUSE recognizes Ubuntu and can accurately call its images
        (including special switches) and mount the partitions. However, most operating systems are only partially
        multi-boot compliant. A little later on, I will show you how the Ubuntu entry could have been treated
        differently, with the same results.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        title Windows<br>
        rootnoverify (hd0,0)<br>
        chainloader (hd0,0)+1
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">rootnoverify (hd0,0)</span> means that openSUSE cannot understand Windows operating
          system, i.e. no multi-boot compliance. Therefore, the operating system is called without any fore-knowledge
          of the kernel. GRUB assumes that the relevant boot images will be found on the target partition and
          <span class="red_text">mounted</span> by the other operating system bootloader. As you can see, Windows was
          installed on the <span class="red_text">first</span> partition of the <span class="red_text">first</span>
          hard disk. This is the most convenient option.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">chainloader (hd0,0)+1</span> feature is used for operating systems that cannot be
          booted directly. Not surprisingly, Windows operating systems cannot be booted directly. They are booted by
          the method of <span class="red_text">chainloading</span>. As the name implies, GRUB passes the control of the
          boot sequence to another bootloader, located on the device to which the menu entry points. This can be a
          Windows operating system, but also any other, including Linux.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Back to Ubuntu. You remember that I have told we could have booted Ubuntu in an alternative way? Indeed, we
        could have simply chainloaded it, just like Windows.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        title Ubuntu<br>
        root (hd0,8)<br>
        chainloader (hd0,8)+1
      </div>
      <p>
        This would have worked equally well. The last option in the menu allows you to boot SUSE in the <span class=
        "red_text">failsafe</span> mode (sort of Safe Mode, no graphics) and does not contribute to our knowledge,
        therefore we will skip it at the moment. Let's see some more examples. The example below is actually written in
        the <span class="red_text">Ubuntu menu.lst</span> (commented, of course).
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        title Windows 95/98/NT/2000<br>
        root (hd0,0)<br>
        makeactive<br>
        chainloader +1<br>
        <br>
        title Linux<br>
        root (hd0,1)<br>
        kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda3 ro
      </div>
      <p>
        By now, you should be able to "read" GRUB language with ease. We begin with the <span class=
        "red_text">title</span>. <span class="red_text">root</span> specifies the partition where we expect to find the
        Windows kernel and <span class="red_text">mounts</span> it (<span class="red_text">rootnoverify</span> would
        leave this job to the Windows bootloader). <span class="red_text">makeactive</span> command sets the
        <span class="red_text">active</span> partition on the root disk (above) to <span class="red_text">GRUB root
        device</span>. This means that the next command, <span class="red_text">chainloader</span>, is executed without
        the target partition specified (as the target partition is the same, now).
      </p>
      <p>
        The second entry is even simpler. We name a Linux, we call its partition and we boot the kernel. In this case,
        we see the very interesting case where the <span class="red_text">kernel image</span> and <span class=
        "red_text">root (/) partition</span> of the operating system are NOT located on the same partition. This would
        be a very likely case for older computers - or ones with a specific boot partition. Finally, the crazy stuff:
        <a href="http://www.justlinux.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=143973">A GRUB menu booting 100+ systems of

      </h3>
      <p>
        GRUB can be installed to a variety of devices. Most people will be interested in setting up GRUB on their hard
        disk. Nevertheless, it does not hurt to know learn about other options. Of course, you can skip forward. Before
        we install anything, we need to know where our files are. If installed, GRUB menu is located on the root
        partition under:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        /boot/grub/menu.lst
      </div>
      <p>
        Always, always back this file up before making any changes! The GRUB files can be found in the image of your
        operating system (usually a CD), under:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc
      </div>
      <p>
        You should also be aware of the basic Linux commands regarding the hard disks and partitions. To this end, you
        might want to try my article <a href="linux_commands.html">Highly useful Linux commands &amp;
        configurations</a>. Nevertheless, for those who do not fancy reading yet another article, here's a brief
        version:
      </p>
      <p>
        You can display your PC environment information either through terminal or a text editor. Files through text
        editor are invoked by specifying the text editor and a target file (with su or sudo for system files).
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        sudo vi /etc/fstab<br>
        <span class="bold_text">OR</span><br>
        sudo gedit /etc/fstab
      </div>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can simply print the contents of the files in the terminal by using the <a href=
        "http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1322">cat</a> (concatenate) command.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        (sudo) cat /etc/fstab
      </div>
      <p>
        Some useful commands that one might need when dealing with boot, hard drives and partitions: Display the
        partition table:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        fdisk -l
      </div>
      <p>
        Display the mounted partitions:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        cat /etc/fstab
      </div>
      <p>
        Now that we know what we need and where to find it, it's time to install GRUB.

        "grub_floppy"></a>GRUB on a floppy disk
      </h4>
      <p>
        To create GRUB on a floppy disk, we must copy the <span class="red_text">Stage 1</span> and <span class=
        "red_text">Stage 2</span> files from the image directory to the <span class="red_text">first</span> and
        <span class="red_text">second sector</span> of the floppy disk. We'll use the <a href=
        "http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1320">dd</a> command, which copies information sector by sector. Here's
        the set of commands that you need to execute (taken from the Manual):
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        cd /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc<br>
        dd if=stage1 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 count=1<br>
        dd if=stage2 of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 seek=1
      </div>
      <p>
        Just a short explanation: <span class="red_text">if</span> stands for input file, <span class=
        "red_text">of</span> stands for output file, <span class="red_text">/dev/fd0</span> refers to the first mounted
        floppy device, <span class="red_text">bs</span> specifies the block size (in bytes), <span class=
        "red_text">count</span> instructs how many blocks should be copied, and <span class="red_text">seek</span>
        tells how many blocks should be skipped before writing. Not surprisingly, since we need to write the files to
        the first two sectors of the floppy disk, we write <span class="red_text">stage1</span> to the <span class=
        "red_text">first</span> sector, and copy <span class="red_text">stage2</span> to the <span class=
        "red_text">second</span> (skip first, then write). Now that we have taken this deep fancy for the command line,
        I'll leave you with the nuances of different commands for homework. More on <span class="red_text">dd</span> on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29">Wikipedia</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the GRUB on floppy, that's it. Since we have copies the stages from OS image, all of the required
        information is there. Of course, you can always make manual adjustments. But that's the next chapter.
      </p>
      <h4>
        <a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId432831" id="mozTocId432831"></a><a name="grub_native" id=
        "grub_native"></a>Installing GRUB natively
      </h4>
      <p>
        Native install means placing <span class="red_text">GRUB Stage 1</span> in the <span class="red_text">first
        sector</span> of the hard disk (<span class="red_text">MBR</span> or <span class="red_text">Partition
        Table</span>). This means you will be able to boot without a secondary device, like a floppy disk (which have
        become a rarity nowadays). However, this also means that if you install an inconsiderate OS later on (like
        Windows) or try to repair the MBR for some reason (by running fdisk /MBR from DOS prompt), you will erase the
        GRUB and render all systems listed in the menu.lst unbootable.
      </p>
      <p>
        To install GRUB in MBR, you will need to boot from external media (floppy, live Linux CD). Then, once you reach
        the GRUB prompt, execute the following commands:
      </p>
      <p>
        Find the <span class="red_text">GRUB root device</span>:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        find /boot/grub/stage1
      </div>
      <p>
        GRUB will search for all available <span class="red_text">Stages 1</span> and present them. If you have more
        than one operating system image present (e.g. SUSE, Kubuntu, Mandriva), you will have more than one
        <span class="red_text">stage1</span> available. Example - Let's say the computer has the following operating
        systems installed on different partitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">SUSE</span> on <span class="red_text">(hd0,1)</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">Kubuntu</span> on <span class="red_text">(hd0,2)</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="red_text">Mandriva</span> on <span class="red_text">(hd0,4)</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All these will be returned as potential roots for GRUB device (as each OS has its own files). If you wish to
        use <span class="red_text">SUSE GRUB</span>, then you will setup the <span class="red_text">GRUB root
        device</span> to <span class="red_text">(hd0,1)</span>:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        root (hd0,1)
      </div>
      <p>
        If you want <span class="red_text">Mandriva's GRUB</span>, then:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        root (hd0,4)
      </div>
      <p>
        If you know in advance what you want to do, you can skip the find command. Once you have decided on the root,
        you need to write the information to the MBR:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        setup (hd0)
      </div>
      <p>
        Finally, quit the GRUB prompt:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        quit
      </div>
      <p>
        As a sequence, the commands that you need are:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        find /boot/grub/stage1 (optional)<br>
        root (hdX,Y)<br>
        setup (hd0)<br>
        quit
      </div>
      <p>
        You can also setup GRUB on another drive or partition, but then you will have to <span class=
        "red_text">chainload</span> GRUB to another bootloader for this to work. That's it. Easy peasy orange squeasy!

      </h4>
      <p>
        This method is considered less safe (according to the Manual), as it guesses the mapping. Still, for total
        newbs in need of dire help, this might be the preferred method. You only need to invoke a single command -
        namely, where to install the bootloader. Furthermore, this command can be written in several ways, all
        equivalent:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        grub-install /dev/hda
      </div><br>
      <div class="divtable6">

      </div><br>
      <div class="divtable6">

      </div><br>
      <div class="divtable6">
        grub-install hd0
      </div>
      <p>
        After you have installed the GRUB, your operating systems should boot. Once booted, you can once again start
        playing with GRUB, manually changing settings - adding and removing entries, chainloading other bootloaders, or
        even hiding and unhiding partitions.

      </h4>
      <p>
        First, before you make any changes to the GRUB configuration file, it is most warmly recommended that you
        backup the existing menu. You might even consider copying to another machine or printing the menu, in case
        things go bunkerous.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        cp /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst_backup
      </div>
      <p>
        To access GRUB, execute the following command in Linux terminal:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        sudo grub
      </div>
      <p>
        After a few moments, the GRUB command line should show up. You can identify it by the <span class=
        "red_text">grub&gt;</span> prompt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img style="width: 640px; height: 378px;" alt="GRUB prompt" src="../images/computers/grub_prompt.jpg">
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can reach the GRUB command line during bootup. When the GRUB menu loads, press <span class=
        "red_text">C</span> on the keyboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say you have installed yet another operating system on your machine, Sabayon. During the installation,
        you skip the GRUB setup. This means that the original GRUB remains untouched - and it does not contain an entry
        about Sabayon. For all practical purposes, Sabayon is not bootable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: GRUB menu entries are called <span class="red_text">stanzas</span> (probably a twist of instance?). So,
        we need to add Sabayon to the list. If you know where Sabayon is installed, you just need to add its entry to
        the menu.lst.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        title Sabayon<br>
        root (hdX,Y)<br>
        chainloader +1
      </div>
      <p>
        That's it. You can also do this while booting the computer, without editing the menu. When the original GRUB
        comes up, press <span class="red_text">C</span> to reach the command line. And then:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        root (hdX,Y)<br>
        chainloader +1
      </div>
      <p>
        Optionally, you will use the <span class="red_text">find</span> command to get around. Basically, this is the
        whole of GRUB magic. As you can see, it's very very simple. But for people who have never heard of GRUB and see
        long lists of strange commands, the prospect can be daunting. Now that we have covered the basics of grubbing,
        it's time for extras and some more common problems.

        This will often happen if you install Windows after Linux. Windows assumes it's the only operating system in
        the world and does not try to live with existing information present in the MBR; it overwrites it. For people
        with dual-boot and very little knowledge of Linux, this is a disaster. Luckily, it's very easily recoverable
        one.

      </h3>
      <p>
        GRUB cannot directly boot Microsoft operating systems. And sometimes, even chainloading may not work,
        especially if Windows is not installed on the first hard disk. Once again, you should remember that you should
        always install Windows first, on the first hard disk, on the first partition (the rule of three first).
        Nevertheless, even if you have Windows installed on a separate disk, you can solve the problem by <span class=
        "red_text">swapping</span>. You need to perform a <span class="red_text">virtual swap</span> between hard
        disks. Like this:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        map (hd0) (hd1)<br>
        map (hd1) (hd0)
      </div>
      <p>
        After you add these two lines, you should be able to boot into Windows (or DOS, for that matter).
      </p>
      <h3>
        <a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId365788" id="mozTocId365788"></a><a name="more_than_one_windows" id=
        "more_than_one_windows"></a>There is more than one Windows operating system installed on one hard disk
        (Hide/Unhide)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Again, Windows can cause problems if there's more than one instance present on a hard disk, especially if
        installed on primary partitions. When you use the chainloader command, the control is transferred to the
        Windows boot loader, but which one?
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is easily solved by <span class="red_text">hiding</span> and <span class="red_text">unhiding</span>
        partitions. If GRUB hides a partition, it will not be visible by Windows and prevent a possible confusion. Vice
        versa, if you unhide a partition, Windows will detect it and be able to boot from it, without getting confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the example taken from the Manual that demonstrates this point. Let's say we have Windows installed on
        the <span class="red_text">first</span> and the <span class="red_text">second</span> partition of your hard
        disk. We wish to boot the <span class="red_text">first</span> instance of Windows. Then, we need to execute the
        following set of commands to make it all work:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        unhide (hd0,0)<br>
        hide (hd0,1)<br>
        rootnoverify (hd0,0)<br>
        chainloader +1<br>
        makeactive
      </div>
      <h3>
        <a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId431278" id="mozTocId431278"></a><a name="partition_resized" id=
        "partition_resized"></a>You resized a partition; GRUB is gone
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is an interesting case. It can happen after you use a partitioning or an imaging software to make changes
        to the Partition Table. Usually, this will happen when you make such a change in Windows. Linux will not be
        informed of the change, because Windows is blind to anything else on the machine save Microsoft thingies.
        Consequently, GRUB will suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is that most likely the filesystem is damaged and needs to be repaired. Boot from a live CD and
        execute the following commands, assuming you know where Linux partitions are. Check the filesystem:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        fsck.ext2 /dev/hdXY
      </div>
      <p>
        Replace <span class="red_text">X</span> and <span class="red_text">Y</span> with hard disk letter and partition
        number that you want to check (hda2, hdb3, etc.). Create the <span class="red_text">ext2/3 filesystem
        parameters</span> again.
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        tune2fs -j /dev/hdXY
      </div>
      <p>
        Now <span class="red_text">mount</span> the <span class="red_text">root filesystem</span> on <span class=
        "red_text">/mnt/sysimage</span> and run <span class="red_text">grub</span>:
      </p>
      <div class="divtable6">
        mount -t ext2 /dev/hdXY /mnt/sysimage<br>
        OR<br>
        mount -t ext2 /dev/hdXY /mnt/sysimage<br>
        <br>
        cd /mnt/sysimage/sbin<br>
        grub
      </div>
      <p>
        You're back to the familiar grounds. For more information on Linux commands, including <span class=
