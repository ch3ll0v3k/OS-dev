<h3 class="section">3.3 Boot information format</h3>

<p>FIXME: Split this chapter like the chapter &ldquo;OS image format&rdquo;.

   <p>Upon entry to the operating system, the <code>EBX</code> register contains the
physical address of a <dfn>Multiboot information</dfn> data structure,
through which the boot loader communicates vital information to the
operating system. The operating system can use or ignore any parts of
the structure as it chooses; all information passed by the boot loader
is advisory only.

   <p>The Multiboot information structure and its related substructures may be
placed anywhere in memory by the boot loader (with the exception of the
memory reserved for the kernel and boot modules, of course). It is the
operating system's responsibility to avoid overwriting this memory until
it is done using it.

   <p>The format of the Multiboot information structure (as defined so far)
follows:

<pre class="example">             +-------------------+
     0       | flags             |    (required)
             +-------------------+
     4       | mem_lower         |    (present if flags[0] is set)
     8       | mem_upper         |    (present if flags[0] is set)
             +-------------------+
     12      | boot_device       |    (present if flags[1] is set)
             +-------------------+
     16      | cmdline           |    (present if flags[2] is set)
             +-------------------+
     20      | mods_count        |    (present if flags[3] is set)
     24      | mods_addr         |    (present if flags[3] is set)
             +-------------------+
     28 - 40 | syms              |    (present if flags[4] or
             |                   |                flags[5] is set)
             +-------------------+
     44      | mmap_length       |    (present if flags[6] is set)
     48      | mmap_addr         |    (present if flags[6] is set)
             +-------------------+
     52      | drives_length     |    (present if flags[7] is set)
     56      | drives_addr       |    (present if flags[7] is set)
             +-------------------+
     60      | config_table      |    (present if flags[8] is set)
             +-------------------+
     64      | boot_loader_name  |    (present if flags[9] is set)
             +-------------------+
     68      | apm_table         |    (present if flags[10] is set)
             +-------------------+
     72      | vbe_control_info  |    (present if flags[11] is set)
     76      | vbe_mode_info     |
     80      | vbe_mode          |
     82      | vbe_interface_seg |
     84      | vbe_interface_off |
     86      | vbe_interface_len |
             +-------------------+
</pre>
   <p>The first longword indicates the presence and validity of other fields
in the Multiboot information structure. All as-yet-undefined bits must
be set to zero by the boot loader. Any set bits that the operating
system does not understand should be ignored. Thus, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo;
field also functions as a version indicator, allowing the Multiboot
information structure to be expanded in the future without breaking
anything.

   <p>If bit 0 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; word is set, then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mem_*</span></samp>&rsquo; fields
are valid. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mem_lower</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mem_upper</span></samp>&rsquo; indicate the amount of
lower and upper memory, respectively, in kilobytes. Lower memory starts
at address 0, and upper memory starts at address 1 megabyte. The maximum
possible value for lower memory is 640 kilobytes. The value returned for
upper memory is maximally the address of the first upper memory hole
minus 1 megabyte. It is not guaranteed to be this value.

   <p>If bit 1 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; word is set, then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">boot_device</span></samp>&rsquo;
field is valid, and indicates which <span class="sc">bios</span> disk device the boot
loader loaded the OS image from. If the OS image was not loaded from a
<span class="sc">bios</span> disk, then this field must not be present (bit 3 must be
clear). The operating system may use this field as a hint for
determining its own <dfn>root</dfn> device, but is not required to. The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">boot_device</span></samp>&rsquo; field is laid out in four one-byte subfields as
follows:

<pre class="example">     +-------+-------+-------+-------+
     | part3 | part2 | part1 | drive |
     +-------+-------+-------+-------+
</pre>
   <p>The first byte contains the <span class="sc">bios</span> drive number as understood by the
<span class="sc">bios</span> INT 0x13 low-level disk interface: e.g. 0x00 for the first
floppy disk or 0x80 for the first hard disk.

   <p>The three remaining bytes specify the boot partition. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part1</span></samp>&rsquo;
specifies the <dfn>top-level</dfn> partition number, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part2</span></samp>&rsquo; specifies a
<dfn>sub-partition</dfn> in the top-level partition, etc. Partition numbers
always start from zero. Unused partition bytes must be set to 0xFF. For
example, if the disk is partitioned using a simple one-level DOS
partitioning scheme, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part1</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the DOS partition
number, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part2</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part3</span></samp>&rsquo; are both 0xFF. As another
example, if a disk is partitioned first into DOS partitions, and then
one of those DOS partitions is subdivided into several BSD partitions
using BSD's <dfn>disklabel</dfn> strategy, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part1</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the DOS
partition number, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part2</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the BSD sub-partition within
that DOS partition, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part3</span></samp>&rsquo; is 0xFF.

   <p>DOS extended partitions are indicated as partition numbers starting from
4 and increasing, rather than as nested sub-partitions, even though the
underlying disk layout of extended partitions is hierarchical in
nature. For example, if the boot loader boots from the second extended
partition on a disk partitioned in conventional DOS style, then
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part1</span></samp>&rsquo; will be 5, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part2</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">part3</span></samp>&rsquo; will both be
0xFF.

   <p>If bit 2 of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; longword is set, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cmdline</span></samp>&rsquo; field
is valid, and contains the physical address of the command line to
be passed to the kernel. The command line is a normal C-style
zero-terminated string.

   <p>If bit 3 of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mods</span></samp>&rsquo; fields
indicate to the kernel what boot modules were loaded along with the
kernel image, and where they can be found. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mods_count</span></samp>&rsquo; contains
the number of modules loaded; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mods_addr</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the physical
address of the first module structure. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mods_count</span></samp>&rsquo; may be zero,
indicating no boot modules were loaded, even if bit 1 of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; is
set. Each module structure is formatted as follows:

<pre class="example">             +-------------------+
     0       | mod_start         |
     4       | mod_end           |
             +-------------------+
     8       | string            |
             +-------------------+
     12      | reserved (0)      |
             +-------------------+
</pre>
   <p>The first two fields contain the start and end addresses of the boot
module itself. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">string</span></samp>&rsquo; field provides an arbitrary string to
be associated with that particular boot module; it is a zero-terminated
ASCII string, just like the kernel command line. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">string</span></samp>&rsquo; field
may be 0 if there is no string associated with the module. Typically the
string might be a command line (e.g. if the operating system treats boot
modules as executable programs), or a pathname (e.g. if the operating
system treats boot modules as files in a file system), but its exact use
is specific to the operating system. The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">reserved</span></samp>&rsquo; field must be
set to 0 by the boot loader and ignored by the operating system.

   <p><strong>Caution:</strong> Bits 4 &amp; 5 are mutually exclusive.

   <p>If bit 4 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; word is set, then the following fields in
the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:

<pre class="example">             +-------------------+
     28      | tabsize           |
     32      | strsize           |
     36      | addr              |
     40      | reserved (0)      |
             +-------------------+
</pre>
   <p>These indicate where the symbol table from an a.out kernel image can be
found. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">addr</span></samp>&rsquo; is the physical address of the size (4-byte unsigned
long) of an array of a.out format <dfn>nlist</dfn> structures, followed
immediately by the array itself, then the size (4-byte unsigned long) of
a set of zero-terminated <span class="sc">ascii</span> strings (plus sizeof(unsigned long) in
this case), and finally the set of strings itself. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tabsize</span></samp>&rsquo; is
equal to its size parameter (found at the beginning of the symbol
section), and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">strsize</span></samp>&rsquo; is equal to its size parameter (found at
the beginning of the string section) of the following string table to
which the symbol table refers. Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tabsize</span></samp>&rsquo; may be 0,
indicating no symbols, even if bit 4 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; word is set.

   <p>If bit 5 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; word is set, then the following fields in
the Multiboot information structure starting at byte 28 are valid:

<pre class="example">             +-------------------+
     28      | num               |
     32      | size              |
     36      | addr              |
     40      | shndx             |
             +-------------------+
</pre>
   <p>These indicate where the section header table from an ELF kernel is, the
size of each entry, number of entries, and the string table used as the
index of names. They correspond to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">shdr_*</span></samp>&rsquo; entries
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">shdr_num</span></samp>&rsquo;, etc.) in the Executable and Linkable Format (<span class="sc">elf</span>)
specification in the program header. All sections are loaded, and the
physical address fields of the <span class="sc">elf</span> section header then refer to where
the sections are in memory (refer to the i386 <span class="sc">elf</span> documentation for
details as to how to read the section header(s)). Note that
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">shdr_num</span></samp>&rsquo; may be 0, indicating no symbols, even if bit 5 in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; word is set.

   <p>If bit 6 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; word is set, then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mmap_*</span></samp>&rsquo; fields
are valid, and indicate the address and length of a buffer containing a
memory map of the machine provided by the <span class="sc">bios</span>. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mmap_addr</span></samp>&rsquo; is
the address, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">mmap_length</span></samp>&rsquo; is the total size of the buffer. The
buffer consists of one or more of the following size/structure pairs
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">size</span></samp>&rsquo; is really used for skipping to the next pair):

<pre class="example">             +-------------------+
     -4      | size              |
             +-------------------+
     0       | base_addr         |
     8       | length            |
     16      | type              |
             +-------------------+
</pre>
   <p>where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">size</span></samp>&rsquo; is the size of the associated structure in bytes, which
can be greater than the minimum of 20 bytes. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">base_addr</span></samp>&rsquo; is the
starting address. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">length</span></samp>&rsquo; is the size of the memory region in bytes. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">type</span></samp>&rsquo; is the variety of address range represented, where a
value of 1 indicates available <span class="sc">ram</span>, and all other values currently
indicated a reserved area.

   <p>The map provided is guaranteed to list all standard <span class="sc">ram</span> that should
be available for normal use.

   <p>If bit 7 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drives_*</span></samp>&rsquo; fields
are valid, and indicate the address of the physical address of the first
drive structure and the size of drive structures. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drives_addr</span></samp>&rsquo;
is the address, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drives_length</span></samp>&rsquo; is the total size of drive
structures. Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drives_length</span></samp>&rsquo; may be zero. Each drive
structure is formatted as follows:

<pre class="example">             +-------------------+
     0       | size              |
             +-------------------+
     4       | drive_number      |
             +-------------------+
     5       | drive_mode        |
             +-------------------+
     6       | drive_cylinders   |
     8       | drive_heads       |
     9       | drive_sectors     |
             +-------------------+
     10 - xx | drive_ports       |
             +-------------------+
</pre>
   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">size</span></samp>&rsquo; field specifies the size of this structure. The size
varies, depending on the number of ports. Note that the size may not be
equal to (10 + 2 * the number of ports), because of an alignment.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_number</span></samp>&rsquo; field contains the BIOS drive number. The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_mode</span></samp>&rsquo; field represents the access mode used by the boot
loader. Currently, the following modes are defined:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>CHS mode (traditional cylinder/head/sector addressing mode).

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>LBA mode (Logical Block Addressing mode). 
</dl>

   <p>The three fields, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_cylinders</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_heads</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_sectors</span></samp>&rsquo;, indicate the geometry of the drive detected by the
<span class="sc">bios</span>. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_cylinders</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the number of the
cylinders. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_heads</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the number of the
heads. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_sectors</span></samp>&rsquo; contains the number of the sectors per
track.

   <p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">drive_ports</span></samp>&rsquo; field contains the array of the I/O ports used
for the drive in the <span class="sc">bios</span> code. The array consists of zero or more
unsigned two-bytes integers, and is terminated with zero. Note that the
array may contain any number of I/O ports that are not related to the
drive actually (such as <span class="sc">dma</span> controller's ports).

   <p>If bit 8 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, then the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">config_table</span></samp>&rsquo; field
is valid, and indicates the address of the <span class="sc">rom</span> configuration table
returned by the <dfn>GET CONFIGURATION</dfn> <span class="sc">bios</span> call. If the <span class="sc">bios</span>
call fails, then the size of the table must be <em>zero</em>.

   <p>If bit 9 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">boot_loader_name</span></samp>&rsquo; field
is valid, and contains the physical address of the name of a boot
loader booting the kernel. The name is a normal C-style zero-terminated
string.

   <p>If bit 10 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">apm_table</span></samp>&rsquo; field is
valid, and contains the physical address of an <span class="sc">apm</span> table defined as
below:

<pre class="example">             +----------------------+
     0       | version              |
     2       | cseg                 |
     4       | offset               |
     8       | cseg_16              |
     10      | dseg                 |
     12      | flags                |
     14      | cseg_len             |
     16      | cseg_16_len          |
     18      | dseg_len             |
             +----------------------+
</pre>
   <p>The fields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">version</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cseg</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">offset</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cseg_16</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dseg</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cseg_len</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cseg_16_len</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">dseg_len</span></samp>&rsquo; indicate the version number, the protected mode 32-bit
code segment, the offset of the entry point, the protected mode 16-bit
code segment, the protected mode 16-bit data segment, the flags, the
length of the protected mode 32-bit code segment, the length of the
protected mode 16-bit code segment, and the length of the protected mode
16-bit data segment, respectively. Only the field &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">offset</span></samp>&rsquo; is 4
bytes, and the others are 2 bytes. See
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/busbios/amp_12.htm">Advanced Power Management (APM) BIOS Interface Specification</a>, for more information.

   <p>If bit 11 in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">flags</span></samp>&rsquo; is set, the graphics table is available. 
This must only be done if the kernel has indicated in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Multiboot Header</span></samp>&rsquo; that it accepts a graphics mode.

   <p>The fields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vbe_control_info</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vbe_mode_info</span></samp>&rsquo; contain
the physical addresses of <span class="sc">vbe</span> control information returned by the
<span class="sc">vbe</span> Function 00h and <span class="sc">vbe</span> mode information returned by the
<span class="sc">vbe</span> Function 01h, respectively.

   <p>The field &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vbe_mode</span></samp>&rsquo; indicates current video mode in the format
specified in <span class="sc">vbe</span> 3.0.

   <p>The rest fields &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vbe_interface_seg</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vbe_interface_off</span></samp>&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">vbe_interface_len</span></samp>&rsquo; contain the table of a protected mode interface
defined in <span class="sc">vbe</span> 2.0+. If this information is not available, those
fields contain zero. Note that <span class="sc">vbe</span> 3.0 defines another protected
mode interface which is incompatible with the old one. If you want to
use the new protected mode interface, you will have to find the table
yourself.

   <p>The fields for the graphics table are designed for <span class="sc">vbe</span>, but
Multiboot boot loaders may simulate <span class="sc">vbe</span> on non-<span class="sc">vbe</span> modes, as
if they were <span class="sc">vbe</span> modes.
