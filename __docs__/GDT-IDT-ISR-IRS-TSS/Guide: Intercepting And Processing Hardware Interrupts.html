<h2>PART I</h2>

<p>Begginer's guide. This is to describe what are
hardware interrupts and how are they processed by an IBM PC
compatible. If you have already worked with handling hardware
interrupts skip this part.</p>

<h3>1. First acquaintance with hardware interrupts.</h3>

<p>Contemporary computer is maintaining lots and various of devices --
hard disk, video card, keyboard, mouse, printer etc. Most of the time
these devices work autonomously and require none of special CPU
attention.

<p>For example the keyboard needs to inform the CPU only when a key is
pressed or released, most of the time CPU knows nothing what happens
with this device. When a key is pressed the keyboard REQUESTS special
attention by the CPU, when the current instruction is completed it
temporarily discontinues executing the main program and starts a
special chunk of code to proceed keyboard's request. This piece of code
gets the key pressed and informs the keyboard device that the
information is processed, which enables the keyboard to perform a new
request when a new key is available. When the request is resolved the
main program continues to be executed exactly at the point where it was
left.

<p>Such a request has its special name <i>Interrupt Request or
IRQ.</i> The CPU maintains a special table with addresses for 15
interrupt requests. The chunk of code resolving an interrupt request
is usually called <i>driver</i>. Such a driver in most of the cases
is provided by the operating system, the device manufacturers or rarely
by the BIOS.

<h3>2. Hardware interrupt controller - 8259.</h3>

<p>As more than one device can request interrupt at one and the same
time there is a special controller provided in every IBM PC compatible
-- Intel 8259 Interrupt Controller (actually there are two of them).
8259 serves two purposes in general: to accumulate requests and to
convey them one by one to the CPU. Acquiring complete documentation of
this controller will easily distract you from IRQ processing material.
But following the 8259 processes with examples makes it simple
to understand the very nature of IRQs. Let us have two requests at one
and the same time,the first will be PC timer and the second will be the
keyboard. Both devices make a request to 8259 so that the CPU should
serve
particular events. 8259 accepts the requests. First is the timer that
interrupts the CPU having higher priority than the keyboard. When the
timer driver serves the request it issues an end-of-interrupt command
to 8259, which directs the controller to initiate keyboard interrupt
toward the CPU. The keyboard interrupt driver complies to the same
end-of-interrupt command, which then makes 8259 available to further
accumulate interrupt requests. Below is how will timer and keyboard
drivers look in peace of code.

<pre>
void TimerDriver(void)
{
  ++TimerCount;
  outpotb(0x20, inportb(0x20));   /* End-Of-Interrupt command */
}

void KbdDriver(void)
{
  unsigned char control_kbd;

  LastKey = inportb(0x60);

  /* Tell the keyboard that the key is processed */
  control_kbd = inportb(0x61);
  outportb(0x61, control_kbd | 0x80);  /* set the "enable kbd" bit */
  outportb(0x61, control_kbd);  /* write back the original control value */
  outpottb(0x20, inportb(0x20));  /* End-Of-Interrupt command */
}
</pre>

<p>It is not necessary to actually know how End-Of-Interrupt command
works, you only need to know that such a command is necessary for the
successful accomplishment of a hardware interrupt.

<p>CPU can be directed not to serve hardware interrupts by
<tt>disable()</tt> and enabled back by <tt>enable()</tt>. 8259 can be
directed not to convey specific device interrupt requests to the CPU.
There is an example below that enables and disables timer interrupts
from being
processed.

<pre>
void DisableTimer(void)
{
  outportb(0x21, inportb(0x21) | 1);
}

void EnableTimer(void)
{
  outportb(0x21, inportb(0x21) &amp; ~1);
}
</pre>

<p>For each of the devices connected to 8259 controller there is a bit
which when set to 1 disables and when set to 0 enables this particular
device. By software point of view this is all that should be known for
8259 interrupt controller. Below is a table which shows interrupt
priorities. The devices 0-7 are connected to the primary and 8-15
connected to secondary interrupt controller. Secondary interrupt
controller can be accessed via ports 0xa0 and 0xa1.

<pre>
 0 System timer
 1 Keyboard
 2 Cascaded second interrupt controller
 3 COM2 - serial interface
 4 COM1 - serial interface
 5 LPT - parallel interface
 6 Floppy disk controller
 7 Available
 8 CMOS real-time clock
 9 Sound card
10 Network adapter
11 Available
12 Available
13 Numeric processor
14 IDE -- Hard disk interface
15 IDE -- Hard disk interface
</pre>

<p>The map of interrupt controllers may vary depending on the
installed devices and their configuration.

<h2>PART II</h2>

<p>Advanced guide in handling hardware interrupts
under 32-bit DPMI server.<p>

<h3>3. IRQ handling in real and 32-bit protected-mode (under DPMI).</h3>

<p>While compiled with DJGPP your program runs in 32-bit
protected-mode. But as DOS is a real-mode operating system there are
special kind of executives to provide an environment for 32-bit
programs -- DPMI servers (DPMI stands for DOS Protected Mode
Interface). While providing smooth execution of 32-bit code, the DPMI
host is switching to real-mode to execute DOS API code, and switching
back to protected-mode to continue executing your code.

<p>There is a certain difference in handling IRQs while in real and
protected mode. 80x86 family of CPUs maintain an interrupt vectors
table starting at 0x0:0x0. DOS API provides two functions to attach
and detach interrupt handlers for a specific vector in this table. By
indicating to the CPU that an IRQ is to be served the 8259 controller
issues an interrupt vector. Using this information the CPU fetches the
address of a driver routine. The consecutive execution of the current
program flow is temporarily discontinued. The CPU stores the current
address and flag status onto the stack and then starts to execute the
driver code. When the driver accomplishes the CPU continues the current
program execution by extracting back the current address and flags
from the stack. The 8259 vectors are mapped in the CPU interrupt
vector table starting by default at #8.

<p>While running in 32-bit mode the CPU maintains an Interrupt
Descriptor Table (IDT) which differs from interrupt vectors table
in real mode. The DPMI host directs the CPU to start using IDT instead
of interrupt vectors table. The list of drivers is kept in virtual
interrupt vector table. When an interrupt occurs, the host checks this
virtual interrupt vector table and, if the IRQ is to be served by
protected mode driver, the CPU starts to execute 32-bit code. DPMI host
guarantees that, even when an IRQ occurs while CPU executes real-mode
code, the correct 32-bit driver will be executed. If your program runs
in a kind of v86 mode  environment (EMM386 or QEMM in config.sys, or
under Windows DOS prompt) an IRQ will be served much more faster if
the driver is 32-bit code.

<p>DPMI host provides virtual memory as portions of code or data
memory can be paged out on disk when not in use, and brought back when
this particular code or data is requested by the program flow of
execution. As DOS is not reentrant in its API functions the disk
operations are not reentrant too. Which, said in other words, means
never to rely on calling disk read/write operation while the prvious one
is
not accomplished. This prevents 32-bit driver code to be randomly read
in or paged out to disk swap file. The DPMI host provides a set of
functions to claim that a portion of code or data should be excluded
from paging process, which means that the memory regions are
<i>locked</i>.
All function and data portions accesed by the driver code should be
locked before claiming certain IRQ.

<p>Invoking your driver code to handle an IRQ the DPMI host provides
only a bare minimum of stack space. It is your responsibility to switch
to vaster space for stack use. Your driver should save upon
entering and restore upon exiting all the registers and CPU flags. All
segment registers should be loaded with their proper selectors in
order to access driver data (and stack).

<h3>4. Writing a <i>wrapper</i> for a hardware interrupts handler.</h3>

<p>As there is a list of tasks that each interrupt handling routine
should perform receiving a request, a special <i>wrapper</i> module will

be presented below. Understanding this module needs special knoledge
in 80386 assembler and AT&amp;T style assembler. However, being not in
possesion of such advanced skills, you may consider this module a black
box as its functionality will be described in the best possible details.

<p>Wrapper functionality is described in exactly 9 steps.

<ol>
<li> save all 80386 registers that may be destroyed by the IRQ
handler
<li> let all segment registers to point handler's data segment by
loading the proper selector
<li> enough stack area should be in disposition to the stack pointer
register
<li> invoke user IRQ handler
<li> restore original stack settings
<li> restore all 80386 registers
<li> if necessary call original IRQ handler (this one being default upon

program start)
<li> disable interrupts as expected by the DPMI server
<li> exit with "return from interrupt" instruction
</ol>

<p>All of the steps revealed in details:

<ol>

<li> save all 80386 registers. This is done by simply pushing all
the resigters in the stack. On exit they will be poped back.
<li> load segment registers. In DJGPP all segments by default point
to the same segment (flat memory). Thus all of them may be loaded by a
single
selector value. DJGPP provides a cs relative variable that is always
an IRQ secured selector -- <tt>__djgpp_ds_alias</tt>.
<li> let the stack pointer sp point to an area of enough stack space.
The wrapper should be provided with a table of readily allocated stacks
--
<tt>_IRQStacks</tt>. The wrapper searches for an available stack. If
successfull, marks the stack as used; this will prevent other IRQs from
allocating the same stack. If the stack search is not successfull, the
wrapper exits IRQ unserved. This may lead to computer lock-up, that is
why enough stacks should be ensured in <tt>_IRQStacks</tt>.
<li> call the proper IRQ handler. IRQ handler call-back functions
should be set in <tt>_IRQHandlers</tt> array. As the wrapper knows its
IRQ number, the proper handler is invoked.
<li> restore the original stack frame; the old stack frame was stored in

the new stack. Pop the old frame and load ss:sp with this value.
<li> restore all 80386 CPU registers. Pop the registers from stack.
<li> the handler is a call-back function in format <tt> int
IRQHandler(void)</tt>. If the handler returns 1, the default IRQ
handler is to be called. Before attaching particular wrapper to
interrupt vector, the old value should be stored in
<tt>_OldIRQVectors</tt>
table. The wrapper jumps to a particular old vector instead of
proceeding
with step 9; the original old handler will finish the interrupt
request with a "return-from-interrupt" intstruction. Before jumping
the CPU registers are restored from the stack.
<li> disable the interrupts before returning to DPMI. DPMI expects
the interrupts disabled upon returning.
<li> Finish by a "return-from-interrupt" instruction.

</ol>

<p>Below is the actual code of a wrapper module.

<p>The file is "wrap_g.S". 'S' is capital to direct gcc to provide
preprocessor support for the file. The wrapper is defined as a macros
and then multiplicated to generate code for all the 16 IRQ wrappers.
All the wrappers' addresses fill an array <tt>(_IRQWrappers) </tt>so
that a
particular wrapper could be simply picked up by its index in this
array.

<h3>5. Code and data locking.</h3>

<p>To prevent the code and data accessed by an IRQ
handler from bein paged out, the memory should be locked. The DPMI
server provides
a <tt>__dpmi_lock_linear_region()</tt> function for locking memory
regions.
Below is the code of <tt>LockData()</tt> and <tt>LockCode()</tt>
functions.

<pre>
int LockData(void *a, long size)
{
  unsigned long baseaddr;
  __dpmi_meminfo region;

  if (__dpmi_get_segment_base_address(_my_ds(), &amp;baseaddr) == -1)
    return (-1);

  region.handle = 0;
  region.size = size;
  region.address = baseaddr + (unsigned long)a;

  if (__dpmi_lock_linear_region(&amp;region) == -1)
    return (-1);

  return (0);
}

int LockCode(void *a, long size)
{
  unsigned long baseaddr;
  __dpmi_meminfo region;

  if (__dpmi_get_segment_base_address(_my_cs(), &amp;baseaddr) == -1)
    return (-1);

  region.handle = 0;
  region.size = size;
  region.address = baseaddr + (unsigned long)a;

  if (__dpmi_lock_linear_region(&amp;region) == -1)
    return (-1);

  return (0);
}
</pre>

<p><tt>_my_cs()</tt> and <tt>_my_ds() </tt>returns code and data
segment selectors respectively. Region description structure is filled
with start and end addresses, and then
<tt>__dpmi_lock_linear_region()</tt> is invoked.

<p>Locking a variable
or array looks like this: <tt>LockData(&amp;var, sizeof(var))</tt>; but
how to lock a function when the code size is unknown? When compiled, two

adjacent functions occupy two adjacent memory regions. Now calculating
function code size is a simple address arithmetic. Below is an
example of how to lock an IRQ handler function.

<pre>
void TimerDriver(void)
{
  ++TimerCount;
  outpotb(0x20, inportb(0x20));  /* End-Of-Interrupt command */
}

void EndOfTimerDriver(void)
{
}

...

LockCode(TimerDriver, (long)EndOfTimerDriver - (long)TimerDriver);
</pre>

<p>It is useful to use macroses to facilitate data and code locking.

<pre>
#define END_OF_FUNCTION(x)    static void x##_End() { }

#define LOCK_VARIABLE(x)  LockData((void *)&amp;x, sizeof(x))
#define LOCK_FUNCTION(x)  LockCode(x, (long)x##_End - (long)x)
</pre>

<p>Below is the same example of function and data locking but using
these macros.

<pre>
long TimerCount;

void TimerDriver(void)
{
  ++TimerCount;
  outpotb(0x20, inportb(0x20));  /* End-Of-Interrupt command */
}
END_OF_FUNCTION(TimerDriver);

...

LOCK_FUNCTION(TimerDriver);
LOCK_VARIABLE(TimerCount);
</pre>

<h3>6. Intercepting IRQs, allocating stacks (additional service
functions).</h3>

<p>Intercepting IRQs involves a pair of DPMI functions --
<tt>__dpmi_get_protected_mode_interrupt_vector()</tt> and
<tt>__dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector()</tt>. The original
vector
value is stored in <tt>OldIRQVectors[]</tt> to be used by the wrapper
to invoke the old handler, and to be restored when
<tt>UninstallIRQ()</tt> is called. The wrapper will invoke the proper
user
code based on what is loaded in <tt>IRQHandlers[]</tt>. The proper IRQ
wrapper is picked from <tt>IRQWrappers[]</tt>, which is initialized in
wrap_g.S. Only once a setup function <tt>InitIRQ()</tt> is called to
prepare the library for proper use. <tt>UninstallIRQ()</tt> keeps
count of how much IRQ vectors are hooked, and when the last one is
released, a <tt>ShutDownIRQ()</tt> cleaning function is invoked to
release stack space from the heap. Notice that interrupt vectors for
the second (cascaded) IRQ controller are mapped starting at position
0x70. Depending on the IRQ number the proper vector is intercepted.

<pre>
int InstallIRQ(int nIRQ, int (*IRQHandler)(void))
{
  int nIRQVect;
  __dpmi_paddr IRQWrapAddr;

  if (!bInitIRQ)
    if (!InitIRQ())
      return 0;

  if (nIRQ &gt; 7)
    nIRQVect = 0x70 + (nIRQ - 8);
  else
    nIRQVect = 0x8 + nIRQ;

  IRQWrapAddr.selector = _my_cs();
  IRQWrapAddr.offset32 = (int)IRQWrappers[nIRQ];
  __dpmi_get_protected_mode_interrupt_vector(nIRQVect,
&OldIRQVectors[nIRQ]);
  IRQHandlers[nIRQ] = IRQHandler;  /* IRQWrapper will call IRQHandler */

  __dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector(nIRQVect, &IRQWrapAddr);
  return 1;
}

void UninstallIRQ(int nIRQ)
{
  int nIRQVect;
  int i;

  if (nIRQ &gt; 7)
    nIRQVect = 0x70 + (nIRQ - 8);
  else
    nIRQVect = 0x8 + nIRQ;

  __dpmi_set_protected_mode_interrupt_vector(nIRQVect,
&OldIRQVectors[nIRQ]);
  IRQHandlers[nIRQ] = NULL;

  /*
  Check whether all the IRQs are uninstalled and call ShutDownIRQ().
  */
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 16; ++i)
    if (IRQHandlers[i] != NULL)
      return;  /* Still remains a handler */
  ShutDownIRQ();
}
</pre>

<p><tt>InitIRQ()</tt> and <tt>ShutDownIRQ()</tt> are a pair of
functions, called when <tt>InstallIRQ()</tt> is first called and when
<tt>UninstallIRQ </tt> unhooks the last vector that was intercepted.
Init function locks all the data and code memory accessed from an IRQ
call, allocates space for stacks, and rises a flag indicating that the
module is
properly setup. Shut down function disposes the stack space.

<pre>
static int InitIRQ(void)
{
  int i;

  /*
  Lock IRQWrapers[], IRQHandlers[] and IRWrap0()-IRQWrap15().
  */
  if (LOCK_VARIABLE(IRQWrappers) == -1)
    return 0;
  if (LOCK_VARIABLE(IRQHandlers) == -1)
    return 0;
  if (LOCK_VARIABLE(OldIRQVectors) == -1)
    return 0;
  if (LOCK_FUNCTION(IRQWrap) == -1)
    return 0;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; IRQ_STACKS; ++i)
  {
    if ((IRQStacks[i] = malloc(STACK_SIZE)) == NULL)
    ...
    LockData(IRQStacks[i], STACK_SIZE) == -1
    ...
    (char *)IRQStacks[i] += (STACK_SIZE - 16);  /* Stack is incremented downward */
  }
  bInitIRQ = 1;
  return 1;
}

static void ShutDownIRQ(void)
{
  int i;
  char *p;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; IRQ_STACKS; ++i)
  {
    p = (char *)IRQStacks[i] - (STACK_SIZE - 16);
    free(p);
  }
  bInitIRQ = 0;
}
</pre>
