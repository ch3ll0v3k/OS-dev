    <div id="main"><p>Now that we have program-loading under way, it's probably time to talk about
how to get the userspace/kernelspace divide up and running in your kernel.</p>
<p>The plan for this set of notes is straightforwards enough: we'll talk about why
we want the userspace/kernelspace divide in the first place, what usually sits
on either side of the dividing line, and the various (hardware) mechanisms in
place to enforce things. Then we'll talk about how to set up controlled methods
for userspace programs to make requests of the kernel without breaching the
entire divide.</p>
<p>Let's get started, shall we?</p>
<h3 id="userspace-kernelspace">Userspace, Kernelspace</h3>
<p>The first thing we should do is define, exactly, what the difference betwen
userspace and kernelspace is. This is a definition that is really up to the
individual kernel implementation; however, a working definition for the moment
is that anything with its access to hardware restricted in some fashion is said
to be in userspace; anything with unrestricted access is in kernelspace. (Note
that if a program has unrestricted access to hardware but choses not to use it,
it still counts as kernelspace.)</p>
<p>What sort of "access to hardware" are we referring to? Well, in the x86_64
case, physical memory, I/O ports, and control registers. (We probably don't
want userspace processes to be able to change into real mode, except in very
controlled circumstances, for example . . .)</p>
<p>But hold on --- it's often the case (in fact, almost always the case) that a
userspace program wants to access hardware in some fashion. For example, a
program running on Linux can't talk to a hard drive directly, but it definitely
can access the content on the hard drive via a driver of some sort, one that
is presumably in kernelspace . . . the reason this can happen is that
kernelspace can set up an API (usually called "system calls") for userspace
programs to access, allowing access to hardware in a controlled fashion.</p>
<p>We'll get to the actual hardware control mechanisms used to protect memory etc.
in a moment, as first I'd like to digress a bit and talk about what sort of
things should run in restricted environments.</p>
<p>There are two modes of thought with respect to what should be put in userspace,
i.e. have access restricted. Well, what sort of things do we actually have
running on a kernel?</p>
<p>We have the kernel itself (things like memory management, IRQ routing/interrupt
handling, timing), we have drivers (the ATA PIO wrapper, FAT32 filesystem
access, network cards, etc), kernel services (networking stack, VFS, etc), and
userspace programs (shells, text editors, compilers, web browsers, etc).</p>
<p>One possible answer to this is that everything should run with full
permissions. This is the road that DOS (and other similar operating systems of
the time) took; no protection whatsoever. These days, such a mindset is
considered a little archaic; after all, one of the fundamental jobs of a kernel
is to provide protection for programs such that two programs fundamentally
cannot interfere with each others' operation (except in tightly-controlled
manners). A more realistic viewpoint is that everything except userspace
programs should be placed in kernelspace; such a design is called a
"monolithic" kernel.</p>
<p>The exact opposite end of the spectrum are the microkernels ("μkernels", or
ukernels for those without an AltGr key) -- occasionally referred to as
nanokernels, depending on the degree to which this doctrine is taken -- where
only a minimal amount of functionality is placed in the kernel, and the rest is
done in userspace. This "minimal" functionality is often (but not always!) the
memory manager, some sort of inter-process communication support, and support
for use of the hardware protection mechanisms.</p>
<p>Why would we choose one over the other? It's mostly an ideological difference,
but there are a couple of considerations to make. Points in favour of μkernels
include additional stability (portions of the "privileged" software can't
interfere with each other, so one bad driver can't ruin the stability of the
entire system), and potential better parallelization (wrapping portions of the
kernel into independent threads helps immediately with this). Points in favour
of a monolithic design include simpler implementation (you can use the fact
that all state is shared to great effect for simplifying certain things), and
better performance (all state is shared, so passing a message to another part
of the kernel is as simple as providing a pointer; in userspace the memory has
to be copied into the other address space). The main points that people will
refer to for each are stability (μkernels) and speed (monolithic kernels).</p>
<p>However, all of these points can be addressed: with careful design, it is
entirely possible to bring microkernels up to the same performance level as a
monolithic kernel. Careful analysis and separation of code in a monolithic
kernel can provide the same level of stability. Ultimately, you can think of
the distinction as a "first priority" --- do you want your first priority to be
speed or stability?  With some work, the distinction is about as meaningful as
the use of tabs or spaces for code indentation (or the use of vi versus emacs);
vicious disagreement, but ultimately you get the same result.</p>
<p>I personally fall in the μkernel side of the fence; it seems to me that
processors are fast enough now that we can sacrifice a couple percent of speed
for stability and security.</p>
<h3 id="hardware-protection">Hardware protection</h3>
<p>So far we've talked about the philosophy of what kernelspace and userspace are,
and what goes where. The next topic to talk about is what hardware mechanisms
are actually in place to enforce this divide, and how fine/coarse-grained they
are.</p>
<p>We can consider two different categories of "privileges" on a computer: memory
access privileges, and hardware access privileges. In the x86 architecture,
this implies that we care about restricting access to memory regions and ports.
Let's start with ports, because that's easier.</p>
<p>A program should either be able to access a port, or not be able to access a
port. Yes, you can argue that perhaps some programs should be able to perform
port reads but not writes (or vice versa). This may very well be a useful thing
that would add value to particular pieces of hardware . . . however, an
important thing to realize is that ports are -- for the most part -- a <em>legacy</em>
access mechanism, and all hardware using ports that I am currently aware of
will not make much use of this sort of access control. We have, in a sense, a
binary value for each port describing whether the current program can access
that port or not. Thus, under the (reasonable) assumption that we care only
about can use/can not use access control for each port, we just need a
64-kilobit bitmap for each program. A little on the large side (8 kB!), but
we'll get to how it can be compressed in a bit.</p>
<p>An important question now arises: how can we switch between "modes", so that
the processor knows which access control list to use? Clearly, we can't have a
program specify its own port access bitmap directly at run-time; that is, in
some sense, a <em>privileged</em> operation. Thus, it's the kind of thing that really
belongs in kernelspace. So what we need is a flag, now, that determines if a
processor can change its port access bitmap or not. But wait, isn't that just
pushing the problem off again? We still need to know if a program can change
the "can change port access bitmap" flag!</p>
<h4 id="privilege-rings">Privilege rings</h4>
<p>The way this is solved on x86 is via the use of something called privilege
rings. In essence, privilege rings are exactly this sort of "current privilege
level" setting for the current processor; we'll push off the bit about how
privilege ring changes occur for just a moment to describe privilege rings in a
little more detail.</p>
<p>The basic idea is simple: there are four rings, numbered zero through three.
The general idea is that anything that can be done in a privilege ring, can
also be done in any ring with a numerically-lower value. That is to say,
everything is permissible in ring zero, and ring three is the most restricted.</p>
<p>Now, the concept of a privilege ring is much more general than just port
accesses. As a result, privilege rings are used for more than port accesses. In
particular, privilege rings control access to two pieces of information: the
I/O privilege level and the port I/O bitmap. In particular, the I/O privilege
level (usually refered to in Intel literature as IOPL) is the highest numerical
privilege ring with unrestricted access to ports. (Note the "numerical" ---
that is to say, if the IOPL is two, then rings zero, one, and two have
unrestricted access to the I/O port space). When the ring is numerically
greater than the IOPL, the I/O port bitmap comes into play.</p>
<p>The I/O port bitmap is a part of the TSS, or Task-State Segment. We talked a
little bit about the TSS back in the <a href="notes-3">third set</a> of notes; it
essentially stores state, about the current task. Which is Intel parlance for
"program", or "process". Thus, it kind of makes sense that what ports a program
can access are stored there.</p>
<p>But hold on --- can a process access its own TSS? The answer is, well, you can
certainly set things up that way. But that's within the purview of memory
protection, which is a nice segue into that topic.</p>
<h4 id="memory-protection">Memory protection</h4>
<p>There are two topics within the context of memory protection that are useful to
examine. The first is that of segmentation, and the second is that of paging.
We've <a href="notes-1">discussed</a> <a href="notes-2">this</a> <a href="notes-5">before</a>, but not really in
the context of protection. And, in all honesty, most of the times it's been
". . . but we'll talk about this in more detail later." Well, that time has now
come.</p>
<p>It's worth noting at this point that much of what follows on the topic of
segmentation is present for breadth; AMD removed almost all of the segmentation
content from the x86_64 architecture. As such, this is historical and/or
motivational knowledge for many, but is important if you want to actually
understand what many of the data structures you interact with as an OS
developer actually contain. With that out of the way . . .</p>
<p>Recall that a segment is sort of a "window" onto a region of physical memory.
It has a base offset (where the first byte of the segment is located) and a
size (what the last valid byte of the segment is). So, how can we use segments
to control what memory a program can access?</p>
<p>The answer is straightforwards: by restricting what segments a program has
access to.</p>
<p>Segments are set up inside the GDT (or LDT).</p>
<p>TODO: recall what a segment is.</p>
<p>There are a couple of concepts to consider, but the most important one has
already been described: privilege rings. The current privilege ring is
otherwise known as the CPL, or Current Privilege Level.</p>
<p>TODO: how segments provide memory protection</p>
<p>TODO: how CPL/DPL interact for data/code segments</p>
<p>TODO: how segmentation exists in x86_64</p>
