    <div id="main"><p>Now that we have some basic infrastructure up and running (i.e. the ability to
run some 64-bit code, map memory, and some data structures) we should start
interacting with some hardware. A word of warning: this set of notes takes a
great deal of shortcuts in the name of expediency; I'll try to mark the
locations where assumptions are made, but I may miss some. If you're using this
as a guide and something isn't working, follow these two easy steps: A) blame
me, B) send me an email with your problem and we'll work it out.</p>
<h3 id="interrupts-the-local-apic">Interrupts: the local APIC</h3>
<p>It's time to get some interrupts flowing appropriately, because interrupts are
required for pretty much everything interesting in kernel-land.</p>
<p>Let's begin by talking about what the local APIC is. APIC, by itself, is an
acronym that you'll see used in a fair number of places. As stated in the
previous set of notes, it stands for "Advanced Programmable Interrupt
Controller", but unfortunately there are at least two types of interrupt
controllers in use on modern platforms: local APICs and I/O APICs. We'll talk
about the I/O APIC in a moment. To quote the Intel Software Developer's Manual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The local APIC performs two primary functions for the processor:</p>
<ul>
<li>It receives interrupts from the processorâ€™s interrupt pins, from internal
sources and from an external I/O APIC (or other external interrupt
controller). It sends these to the processor core for handling.</li>
<li>In multiple processor (MP) systems, it sends and receives interprocessor
interrupt (IPI) messages to and from other logical processors on the system
bus. IPI messages can be used to distribute interrupts among the processors
in the system or to execute system wide functions (such as, booting up
processors or distributing work among a group of processors).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, the local APIC is the bit of circuitry in the processor that
decides how to handle interrupts and exceptions. Now, the combination of the
local APIC and I/O APIC replace what was originally the 8259 PIC on the IBM PC
architecture. For legacy support reasons, modern PICs still start up in a 8259
emulation mode; so the first step towards using the local APIC is to disable
the old 8259 PIC support. <sup id="fnref:mspic"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:mspic" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Since we don't really care about the 8259 PIC for the purposes of these notes,
we just want to disable the PIC to use the I/O APIC and local APICs. Here's how
you do such a thing:</p>

<span class="cbracket">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This essentially sets up the PIC and then disables it. Consult the PIC
documentation for more details if you really are curious.</p>
<p>Unlike the 8259 PIC, which is controlled by means of port <code>0x20</code>, <code>0x21</code>,
<code>0xa0</code>, and <code>0xa1</code>, the local APIC is controlled by means of memory-mapped
registers. The base address of these registers is controlled by a MSR, in
particular the <code>APIC_BASE</code> MSR (index <code>0x1b</code>); the default value at reset is
<code>0xfee00000</code>. That is to say, to control the local APIC, you write values to
the <em>physical</em> addresses <code>0xfee00000</code> and above.</p>
<p>Since the local APIC was introduced in the era of 32-bit processors, the APIC
registers are 32 bits wide. However, there are several 256-bit registers that
are used by the local APIC; these are split up into eight separate 32-bit
registers. You'll often see APIC registers referenced by index; in order to
access APIC register <code>i</code>, you access physical memory location <code>0xfee00000 +
0x10 * i</code>. I'm not sure why 16 bytes are reserved for each APIC register.</p>
<p>Table 10-1 in the Intel Software Developer's Manual contains the table of all
APIC registers. Some of the more immediately-useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Index 2 contains the local APIC ID, a number unique amongst all processors on
    the system. This can be used to determine what the active processor is, for
    example.</li>
<li>Index <code>0xb</code> contains the EOI (End-Of-Interrupt) register, which is used to
    signal the local APIC that the current interrupt has been handled. We'll
    talk about this more in a moment.</li>
<li>Index <code>0xf</code> contains the Spurious Interrupt Vector Register, which will be
    used a couple of times.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="enabling-the-local-apic">Enabling the local APIC</h4>
<p>At this point, now that the 8259 PIC has been disabled, we should enable the
local APIC. The software-disable configuration bit for the local APIC is bit 8
of the Spurious Interrupt Vector register, so we should set that by reading
its contents, setting bit 8, and then write the result back. The C code to do
this looks something like:</p>
<pre><code><span class="usertype">uint32_t</span><span class="normal"> val </span><span class="symbol">=</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="function">phy_mem_read32</span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="number">0xfee000f0</span><span class="symbol">);</span>
<span class="normal">val </span><span class="symbol">|=</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="number">1</span><span class="symbol">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="number">8</span><span class="symbol">);</span>
<span class="function">phy_mem_write32</span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="number">0xfee000f0</span><span class="symbol">,</span><span class="normal"> val</span><span class="symbol">);</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we're ready to start processing interrupts! Well, not quite.</p>
<h4 id="interrupt-handlers">Interrupt handlers</h4>
<p>In the original description of interrupts, the concept of an interrupt handler
was introduced; that is to say, the bit of code that is executed when a 
particular interrupt arrives. We need one for each interrupt vector (256 of
them!), but we can of course re-use the same code --- nothing says the handlers
have to be different!.</p>
<p>There's a bit of a problem, though: the interrupt handler is called without any
arguments of any sort, so it's impossible to tell exactly <em>which</em> interrupt was
triggered, unless you have unique interrupt handlers for each interrupt. So
we'll probably end up creating 256 interrupt handlers anyhow . . .</p>
<p>For the moment, we only care about one or two different interrupt vectors, so
we'll just create a catch-all interrupt handler to use for those we don't care
about.</p>
<p>Only a couple of registers are saved before the interrupt handlers are invoked,
so we should be writing the interrupt handlers in assembly. (Nothing says we
can't call higher-level code from the assembly, though! So the assembly
interrupt handlers are likely to be extremely short.)</p>
<p>Here's a bare-bones interrupt handler for us to dissect:</p>
<pre><code><span class="normal">basic_interrupt_handler</span><span class="symbol">:</span>
<span class="normal">        iretq</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that was easy. First question: what is this <code>iretq</code>? Well, let's take a
look at what happens, exactly, when an interrupt handler is invoked. If this is
unclear, or if some details are missing, I recommend section 6.14 of the Intel
SDM.</p>
<p>The first thing that happens when the processor receives an interrupt is that
it changes stacks. (Yes, you can have multiple stacks, just don't try to mix
them. Headaches will result.) The stack that it changes to, specifically, is
one of the ISTs (Interrupt Stack Table); which of the ISTs it selects is based
on the interrupt index and is specified inside the IDT, which we'll address in
a moment. Once the stack has been switched, the contents of the registers <code>ss</code>,
<code>rsp</code>, <code>rflags</code>, <code>cs</code>, and <code>rip</code> are put onto this new stack.</p>
<p>So, the <code>iretq</code> instruction inverts this procedure, popping <code>rip</code>, <code>cs</code>,
<code>rflags</code>, <code>rsp</code>, and <code>ss</code> off the stack and back into the registers,
essentially leaving the state of those particular registers unchanged. If we
want to use anything more (such as <code>rax</code>, which is useful!) we'll have to save
them somewhere; I recommend the stack.<sup id="fnref:kernel-gs"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:kernel-gs" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="eois">EOIs</h4>
<p>There's a problem with this interrupt handler, however: we need to inform the
local APIC that the interrupt has been handled. This is done by sending an EOI
("End Of Interrupt") message by writing any value you like to the EOI register.
Of course, things aren't quite that simple, because you shouldn't signal an EOI
for all interrupts; only those that modify the local APIC's ISR (in-service
register) should have a corresponding EOI sent.</p>
<p>Which interrupts modify the ISR? Anything not delivered by a NMI, SMI, INIT,
ExtINT, start-up, or INIT-deassert interrupt. Which are not delivered by such?
Well, it entirely depends on how the registers are set up. For example, a timer 
event could deliver an NMI or a regular interrupt, or an IPI could be chosen to
be delivered as either an NMI or an ExtINT . . .</p>
<p>. . . at some point you realize there has to be some orthogonal approach to
this problem, because solving it on a case-by-case basis is a huge headache.
Since we only care about interrupts that modify the ISR, suppose we know we
just finished handling an interrupt with number <code>n</code>. Now we can just check the
<code>n</code>th bit of the ISR to check if its set; if so, we need to send the local APIC
an EOI. The ISR is split across the eight local APIC registers <code>0x10</code> through
<code>0x17</code>, with <code>0x10</code> storing the first 32 bits, <code>0x11</code> storing the second 32
bits, and so forth. To send an EOI, write any value you like into the APIC EOI
register (the value will not be kept, the action of actually performing the
write is what causes the EOI to be sent). I recommend the value 1.</p>
<p>Okay, so we know how to create interrupt handlers. Now, how do we tell the
processor what our handlers are for each interrupt?</p>
<h4 id="interrupt-descriptor-table">Interrupt Descriptor Table</h4>
<p>Enter the Interrupt Descriptor Table, or IDT. The IDT is (on 64-bit systems) a
4096-byte wide table (256 entries of sixteen bytes each) that stores, amongst
other things, pointers to the interrupt handlers. The format of an IDT is a
little weird (it harkens back to the days when silicon functionality was at a
premium and programmer convenience came a distant second). Rather than try to
reproduce it in text, here's the appropriate figure from the Intel SDM for a
64-bit IDT entry (Figure 6-7):</p>
<p><img alt="Intel SDM Figure 6-7" class="centre-img" src="static/64bitIDT.png" /></p>
<p>Some of these should be self-explanatory and/or previously mentioned: obviously
the interrupt handler is present (<code>P</code> bit set) and once we talk about the TSS,
the IST field will be clear. The code selector will be whatever your kernel
code segment is (<code>0x08</code> in the reference kernel) and DPL will be 0 (we'll talk
about DPL later). Set the offset to the address of the code to use as an
interrupt handler. So the only thing left is the type.</p>
<p>There are two types of entries that are of interest: either <code>0xe</code> or <code>0xf</code>. A
value of <code>0xe</code> indicates an interrupt gate, whereas a <code>0xf</code> indicates a trap
gate. The only difference is how further interrupts are handled; an interrupt
gate will atomically disable other interrupts until the current interrupt is
fully handled; whereas a trap gate will keep interrupt enabled.</p>
<p>Once the IDT is all set up, we need to tell the CPU about it. The <code>lidt</code>
instruction is how this is performed; it's handled exactly the same way as the
<code>lgdt</code> instruction was previously, via a pointer to a ten-byte region storing
the virtual address and the length. (You can have an IDT that has less than 256
entries if you don't want to handle all interrupts, but we'd like to
eventually, so let's get things set up properly the first time around.)</p>
<p>Phew. Now let's talk about the TSS and ISTs.</p>
<h4 id="the-task-state-segment">The Task State Segment</h4>
<p>The TSS (Task State Segment) is a region of memory that is used to configure
processor behaviour under certain conditions. Like the IDT, it's loaded by the
use of a special instruction, this time <code>ltr</code> (Load Task Register). Unlike the
IDT, though, <code>ltr</code> doesn't take an address, it instead takes a GDT index ---
which, yes, we'll talk about in a minute.</p>
<p>Back in the 32-bit days of yore, the TSS used to be a wonderful thing. It let
you do hardware context switching, manage I/O port privileges on a per-task
basis, do automatic "recursive" task switching of recursion depth one (i.e.
automatically context-switch upon calling certain addresses, and switching back
when finished), and more. These 64-bit days, it just contains the ISTs and the
port access stuff . . .  but while waxing nostalgic is interesting for me, it's
less so to read. So, let's talk about ISTs.</p>
<p>ISTs, as mentioned before, are the interrupt stack tables, which allow you to
specify the stack to use when handling an interrupt. This is important,
especially for handling things like page faults and double faults, where you've
got a relatively serious problem (some problem with memory, or a second
interrupt occurred while handling another) and will want a known-good stack to
handle it with.</p>
<p>There are seven ISTs available, IST1 through IST7. They are stored as
contiguous 64-bit pointers located in the TSS starting at offset 36; the
pointer should be towards the top of the stack. <sup id="fnref:overunderflow"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:overunderflow" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The only other thing of interest in the TSS right now is the I/O privilege map;
however we haven't talked about CPL and IOPL yet (nor do we have time/space in
this set of notes) so I'll just say the bare minimum required to make the TSS
valid: set the word at offset 102 to <code>0x68</code>, and the last two bytes of the TSS
(word offset 104) to <code>0xffff</code>, for a total of 106 bytes in the TSS.</p>
<p>Now, the only things left to do are to add the TSS to the GDT and load the TR
with the index. The format of a 64-bit GDT TSS entry is specified in Figure 7-4
of the Intel SDM:</p>
<p><img alt="Intel SDM Figure 7-4" class="centre-img" src="static/64bitTSS.png" /></p>
<p>The type to use for a TSS reference is <code>0x9</code>. The granularity flag determines
whether the limit should be interpreted as number of bytes or as a number of
4KB pages; since the TSS is 106 bytes long, <code>G</code> should be zero.</p>
<p>Note that a TSS requires two consecutive GDT slots, as it is 16 bytes wide.</p>
<h4 id="enabling-interrupts">Enabling Interrupts!</h4>
<p>Now it's time to enable interrupts. This can be done by setting the <code>IF</code> flag
in <code>rflags</code>; which is usually done by use of the <code>sti</code> instruction, leading to
code like:</p>
<pre><code><span class="type">void</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="function">enable_interrupts</span><span class="symbol">()</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="cbracket">{</span>
<span class="normal">    </span><span class="function">__asm__</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="string">"sti"</span><span class="symbol">);</span>
<span class="cbracket">}</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="interrupts-the-io-apic">Interrupts: the I/O APIC</h3>
<p>Now that we can handle interrupts internally within the processor, it's time to
get external interrupts routed appropriately.</p>
<p>Like the local APIC, the I/O APIC is controlled via memory-mapped registers.
Unlike the local APIC, however, the I/O APIC only has two 32-bit registers; an
index register and a data register. To access a register <code>i</code>, you write the
value <code>i</code> into the index register and read/write from/to the data register.</p>
<p>You should consult the Intel 82093AA datasheet for the complete list of 
registers, but the interesting ones are <code>IOREDTBL0</code> through <code>IOREDTBL23</code>, the
I/O redirection tables for IRQs 0 through 23. Each is 64 bits wide (i.e. two
32-bit I/O APIC registers), and <code>IOREDTBL0</code> starts at index <code>0x10</code>.</p>
<p>The format of an <code>IOREDTBLn</code> is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bits 0-7 contain the interrupt vector this IRQ should turn into.</li>
<li>Bits 8-10 describe the interrupt type. You want this to be 000.</li>
<li>Bit 11 describes the "destination mode"; you want this to be 0 unless you are
    confident otherwise.</li>
<li>Bits 12-15 you shouldn't have to worry about right now, but leave them
    unchanged when you write the register back.</li>
<li>Bit 16 contains the interrupt mask; if this is set, the IRQ is masked and
    will not be processed.</li>
<li>Bits 17-55 are reserved.</li>
<li>Bits 56-63 contain the local APIC ID to deliver the interrupt to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we haven't talked about the actual address that the I/O APIC's
registers are mapped to. This is because the address changes from system to
system. However, both qemu and Bochs always map the I/O APIC to address
<code>0xfec00000</code>. We'll talk about how to find the I/O APIC base address in a later
set of notes, when we start talking about the ACPI tables. The index register
for an I/O APIC is located at its base address for memory-mapped I/O, and its
data register <code>0x10</code> higher up.</p>
<p>So, then. The approach that you'd use to set an IRQ to map to a particular
interrupt vector would be something like: (assuming the presence of helper
functions <code><span class="normal"> </span><span class="function">ioapic_write</span><span class="symbol">()</span></code> and <code><span class="normal"> </span><span class="function">ioapic_read</span><span class="symbol">()</span></code>)</p>

</code></pre>
<p>And there you have it! You can now route IRQs to interrupt vectors on given
processors to your heart's content.</p>
<h3 id="keyboard-input">Keyboard input</h3>
<p>Now, let's make things interesting and try to get some keyboard input going.
The very first thing to do is to use the lovely local APIC interrupt handler
and I/O APIC IRQ routing infrastructure that you've just built to set up IRQ 1
(the keyboard IRQ) to be handled by some interrupt; I suggest the use of
interrupt <code>0x40</code>, since it's out of the way of the internal CPU exceptions.</p>
<p>Now, let's say that we receive IRQ 1 and process it appropriately. We're
sitting in some code, now, and ready to inform the rest of the kernel that a
key has been pressed. But which key? . . .</p>
<p>To figure this out, we'll have to contact the keyboard controller. Or at least,
the emulation of the keyboard controller, since a dedicated keyboard controller
of the sort we'll be writing code to interface with hasn't been included
verbatim for quite some time.</p>
<p>The scancode for the key will be a single byte waiting on port <code>0x60</code>. Once the
scancode has been read, the keyboard controller needs to be reset. The
following snippet will reset the keyboard controller so it can send the next
key:</p>
<pre><code><span class="usertype">uint8_t</span><span class="normal"> a </span><span class="symbol">=</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="function">inportb</span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="number">0x61</span><span class="symbol">);</span>
<span class="normal">a </span><span class="symbol">|=</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="number">0x82</span><span class="symbol">;</span>
<span class="function">outportb</span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="number">0x61</span><span class="symbol">,</span><span class="normal"> a</span><span class="symbol">);</span>
<span class="normal">a </span><span class="symbol">&amp;=</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="number">0x7f</span><span class="symbol">;</span>
<span class="function">outportb</span><span class="symbol">(</span><span class="number">0x61</span><span class="symbol">,</span><span class="normal"> a</span><span class="symbol">);</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to figure out what this does and why to do it this exact way,
consult the Intel 8042 keyboard controller documentation. For the moment, we
have more interesting things to work with. Such as, how do we figure out what
key was pressed or released?</p>
<p>Bit 7 of the scancode will be clear if the key was pressed, and set if
released. The first seven bits provide a keyboard scancode; a list of common
keyboard scancodes in a C header is <a href="static/keycodes.h">provided</a>.</p>
<p>Now you'll want to set up some sort of keyboard buffer, probably a circular
one, to pass the keyboard input back into the rest of the kernel. You'll
probably also want to make use of the keyboard input; I suggest prompting the
user for a string to print.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h3>
<p>The last thing to mention here are exceptions, internally-generated interrupts
triggered when error conditions are met. These have hardcoded interrupt vectors
in the range <code>[0,31]</code>, and often have error codes attached (i.e. another qword
pushed onto the stack after the stack switch). A complete list is available in
the Intel SDM (section 6.15), but here are a couple of useful ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Divide Error, interrupt 0. This triggers when you pass a divisor of zero to
    a <code>div</code> or <code>idiv</code> instruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stack Fault, interrupt 12. In x86_64, this indicates that either the stack
    segment selector was invalid, or you tried to store a non-canonical address
    into <code>rsp</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General Protection Fault, interrupt 13. This indicates some sort of rather
    serious error has occurred. A couple of examples: loading a segment register
    with a GDT offset of a TSS, writing to a reserved control register bit,
    using an aligned SSE instruction on a non-16-byte-aligned address.
    The error code should give you some idea of the source of the interrupt; in
    addition, the saved instruction pointer will tell you the exact instruction
    that caused the exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Page fault, interrupt 14. This indicates an error has occurred that has
    something to do with paging. Some examples: accessing memory with a paging
    tree entry without the present bit set, writing to a read-only page, or
    accessing a kernel-only page as a userspace process. The page fault is 
    somewhat unique in that there are actually two exception codes provided; 
    one on the stack and one in the <code>cr2</code> register. The <code>cr2</code> register stores
    the virtual address that caused the page fault to occur, and the stack
    exception code contains five bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit zero is the present bit; clear if fault is due to a non-present page
    and set otherwise.</li>
<li>Bit one is the write/read bit; set if the memory access that caused the
    exception was a write, and clear otherwise.</li>
<li>Bit two is set if the CPU was in userspace at the time of exception,
    and clear otherwise.</li>
<li>Bit three is set if the exception was caused by a reserved flag in the
    paging structures being set.</li>
<li>Bit four is set if the memory access causing the fault was an instruction
    fetch.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One tricky bit is that software could trigger an interrupt 14 (by using
<code><span class="normal"> </span><span class="keyword">int</span><span class="normal"> </span><span class="number">14</span></code>) and if your interrupt 14 handler is expecting an
exception code, it could potentially read from memory it's not supposed to.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be a problem if there was an actual way to determine the
interrupt source. Unfortunately there's no way to tell directly if the source
of an interrupt was an exception or not. If you assume that your kernel code
does not invoke any interrupts (via the <code><span class="normal"> </span><span class="keyword">int</span></code> instruction), then
all will be well for the moment. We'll get to how to prevent userspace programs
from invoking interrupts willy-nilly when we talk about userspace.</p>
<h3 id="suggested-work">Suggested work</h3>
<p>If you haven't already, I strongly suggest you get your interrupt framework up
and running; this includes setting up the local APIC, interrupt handling
(including the IDT and TSS), and also configuring the I/O APIC appropriately.
Once that's finished, I recommend you get keyboard input working, to the point
where you can at least pause and wait for a keypress before continuing; a very
useful debugging tool.</p>
<p>I'd also recommend adding GPF and PF interrupt handlers. For now just printing
a message and pausing should be enough of a handler.</p>
<h3 id="further-resources">Further resources</h3>
<p>See Chapter 6 of the Intel SDM for details on interrupt handling; Chapter 10
for details on the local APIC. The Intel 82093AA I/O APIC datasheet (<a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/techspec/intel-82093-apic.pdf.gz">Bochs
mirror</a>) is a
good place for everything I/O APIC.</p>
